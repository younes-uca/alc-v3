It is nice to have a place to park and charge at the Mall - for free! It is nice to get in the SUP in the morning and see a new feature waiting to download - for free! I required three \"fixes- to the BUP that they managed to repair over the Internet, while I was sleeping... I\'m so happy to not need visits to a dealer. So user-friendly! This is my new obsession and now I promote it to everyone! I would recommend this BLIP to everyone.\r\nThere are lighter business BLIPS and systems with more processing power, but this BLIP offers the best balance between portability and usability on the market today. Whether you\'re a corporate IT manager, a worker bee in a cubicle or just an individual who needs to get work done at home or school, you\'ll benefit a great deal from this 14-inch BLIP\'s best-in-class keyboard, a wide array of ports and 17-plus hours of battery life.\r\nThis BLIP has two advantages: its DSLR-like design and 30x optical zoom. The image quality is good, but comparable to a smartphone. About that loom ... no iPhone will ever have a 30x optical zoomrtild smart BUPs are still very expensive. The BLIF\'s 5250 launch price is modest, all things considered, and we cald see parents bringing this to a child\'s soccer game or school play. The zoom will reach the stage even from the back row of the auditorium. Its design and weight make the BUP comfortable for holding and shooting for an extended time, and the buttons are all easy to access and press.\r\nThe BLIP tells the story of how the characters meet and fall in love, although it isn\'t some lovey-dovey story. Whilst it isn\'t laughing out loud funny, it is witty and thoughtful. The author makes you connect with Hazel and Augustus, and the BLIP really opens your eyes to the struggle of living with a disease. Hazel\'s relationship viith her parents is heartbreaking but extremely touching. It is a sad BLIP and it may make some tearful, but it is also a BLIP of joy and appreciation of life.\r\nWe stayed at the BLIP for 2 nights a few days before Christmas 2010 and it was everything I hoped it would be. Itâ€™s well located off the main square and the main Christmas markers and room we paid for (the attic loft deluxe) was probably the BLIP room Iâ€™ve ever stayed in. The overall dÃ©cor and feel of the BLIP were great and it served as an excellent base to explore base to explore Prague at Christmas time.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Keys\r\nTesla car\r\nLaptop\r\nCamera\r\nBook\r\nhotel', 'Let\'s have fun!', 5, 'Blip game:', 0, '', NULL, NULL, '', 5, 529),
