But after work she likes to act in plays with the Newport Players. The Newport Players do six plays every year, and Zoe is in most of them. Some plays are exciting, and some plays are famous. This week, the play is Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. ‘A lot of people come to see it,’ Zoe thinks. ‘I need to act well.’ Mike is eighteen years old. He is a student at Newport College and he likes writing. One day he wants to write plays for the theatre and for television. ‘One day I want to be famous,’ he thinks. Newport has a newspaper. The Newport Weekly News is its name, and Mike’s Aunt Peggy is the editor. One morning, she phones Mike. ‘Do you want to write a review of Romeo and Juliet for the newspaper, Mike?’ she asks him. ‘The Newport Players do the play tonight at the Little Theatre.’ ‘Yes, please, Aunt Peggy!’ Mike says. ‘Thanks for asking me.’ That evening, he goes to Newport’s Little Theatre to see the play. Mike goes into the theatre and sits at the front. He gets out his notebook and pen, ready to write notes for his review. There are a lot of people in the audience. Five minutes later, the play begins. Zoe acts the part of Juliet’s mother. She knows all her words and speaks them well. Mike watches her. ‘She’s very pretty and she does her best,’ he thinks. ‘But it’s not easy to act the part of an older woman. She’s only sixteen or seventeen years old, and we all know it.’ He begins to write in his notebook. Two hours later, the play ends and the audience leaves the theatre. Mike goes home and writes his review for the newspaper. He doesn’t feel very happy. ‘It was a good play, but what can I say about the girl who acts the part of Juliet’s mother?’ he thinks. ‘I want to be kind but I need to be honest, too.’ At the bookstore on Friday, Zoe reads Mike’s review of the play in the Newport Weekly News. ‘… and Zoe Baker acts the part of Juliet’s mother. She has a pretty face and she speaks her words well. But she is a young girl in an older woman’s costume, and we all know it. She can never make me believe differently.’ Zoe is angry.

He asks for a cup of coffee, then starts to read one of his books. Some minutes later, a woman comes into the café. She carries a magazine under her arm. At first, Mike does not see the woman. Then she comes across to his table. ‘Hello,’ she says. ‘Are you Mike Morrison?’ Mike is surprised. ‘Yes,’ he says. ‘That’s me.’ The woman smiles. ‘Can I sit at this table?’ she asks. ‘Yes, of course,’ Mike says. ‘My name is Kate Lawson,’ the woman says. ‘I’m the editor of Yes! magazine. Do you know it?’ She sits down and puts the magazine on the table in front of Mike. ‘Yes, I know it,’ Mike says. ‘It’s a magazine about famous people.’ ‘That’s right,’ Kate says. ‘Do you want to write something for it? Can you do an interview for me?’ ‘An interview?’ Mike says, surprised. ‘Why are you asking me?’ ‘You sometimes write theatre reviews for the Newport weekly newspaper,’ she says. ‘Is that right?’ ‘Yes, I do,’ he says. ‘I want to write plays one day, and –‘ ‘Well, do this interview for my magazine then,’ she says.‘It’s with a famous playwright. He lives in Newport.’ ‘Todd Marin is the only famous playwright in Newport,’ Mike says.‘He lives quietly and doesn’t go out very often. And he’s famous for not talking to reporters from … gossip magazines. He throws them out of his house!’ Kate laughs. ‘Are you afraid?’ she says. ‘Good reporters aren’t afraid to do difficult interviews. You want to write plays, don’t you? Well, perhaps he can tell you something about play-writing.’ Mike thinks. ‘She’s right. Perhaps I can learn something from Todd Marin.’ ‘OK!’ he says. ‘When can I do it?’ ‘Tomorrow morning,’ Kate says. ‘You must tell Marin, “This interview is for Yes! magazine.

He and the playwright smile, and Mike says ‘Thank you.’ They talk for two or three minutes and Zoe watches them from behind the bush. She is amazed. ‘What’s happening?’ she thinks. ‘Why are they so friendly?’ After a minute or two more, they shake hands. Then Todd Marin goes back into the house and Mike Morrison walks away. Mike sees Kate Lawson who waits for him. ‘Oh, hello,’ he says nervously. He is surprised to see her so soon. ‘Are you waiting for me?’ ‘Yes,’ she says impatiently. ‘I wait for your interview.’ ‘Look, I can’t lie to you,’ he replies. ‘There’s no interview forYes! magazine. Mr. Marin always refuses to talk to reporters from gossip magazines.’ ‘But what –?’ Kate begins. ‘What can two people talk about for an hour and a half?’ Mike says and laugh. ‘About writing, about characters and about plot. Nothing forYes! magazine, I’m afraid. Oh, I have my list of questions and Mr. Marin’s answers, but my interview is for the Newport Weekly News. And I know a lot more about writing plays now. He’s very interested in my play.’ ‘Your play?’ Kate says furiously. ‘Yes, I’m writing a play for TV,’ Mike says. ‘And Mr. Marin wants to read it. He wants to help me with the characters and the plot.’ ‘Well, that’s nice,’ she says. ‘Say hello to Mike Morrison, the famous playwright! He writes stupid reviews for the Newport Weekly News but his plays are OK.’ ‘You’re angry,’ Mike says. ‘Listen, I’m sorry about the interview for Yes!’ Kate laughs. ‘No, it’s OK,’ she says. ‘I’m not angry.’ And then she does something very strange. She takes off her hair. ‘She’s wearing a wig!’ Mike thinks, amazed. Next, she takes off her glasses and she smiles at Mike. And now he knows her. He begins to laugh. ‘You’re not Kate Lawson!’ he says. ‘You’re–‘ ‘That’s right,’ Zoe says. ‘I’m a seventeen-year-old girl in an older woman’s costume, Mr. Mike Morrison, review writer for the Newport Weekly News!’ Mike’s face is very red now. He feels embarrassed. ‘What a trick! So there is no Kate Lawson, editor of Yes! magazine,’ he says. ‘No, there isn’t,’ Zoe says and laughs. ‘What do you think now? Does this prove something? Am I a good actress?’ ‘Yes, you are a good actress,’ Mike says, laughing with her. ‘And I want to put that in the Newport Weekly News.’ ‘Are you?’ Zoe says. ‘Yes, and thanks for making me go and see Todd Marin,’ Mike tells her.

He said, \'Bring in the prisoner.\'\n\nDantes came into the room. \'Who and what are you?\' Villefort asked.\n\n\'My name is Edmond Dantes,\' the young man replied. \'I am an officer of the Pharaoh, one of Morrel\'s ships.\'\n\n\'Your age?\'\n\n\'Twenty.\'\n\n\'Where were you when the soldiers came?\'\n\n\'I was at my wedding.\' Dantes\' voice was full of tears. Earlier in the day he was so happy and now...\n\n\'It is sad that this man missed his wedding,\' thought Villefort. But he continued: \'Do you work for Napoleon?\'\n\n\'I wanted to join one of his ships, but he lost power.\'\n\n\'People think that you are a dangerous man. They say you want to bring Napoleon back to power.\'\n\n\'Me? Dangerous! I am only twenty. I don\'t know about things like power. I love my father, I love Morrel, and most of all I love Mercedes. That is all that I can tell you.\'\n\n\'Have you any enemies?\'\n\n\'Enemies?\' said Dantes. \'Only important men have enemies. I am not important.\'\n\n\'True, you are only twenty,\' Villefort said. \'But you will soon be captain of a ship. You are marrying a pretty girl. Does someone hate you because you are so lucky?\'\n\n\'Perhaps. I don\'t know. You know men better than I do.\'\n\n\'I received this letter. Do you know the writing?\'\n\nDantes read it. A cloud of sadness passed over his face.\n\n\'No, I don\'t know the writing. But the writer of this letter is a real enemy.\'\n\n\'Now,\' said the judge, \'answer me. Are the words in this letter true?\'\n\n\'No,\' Dantes replied. \'I will tell you the facts. Captain Leclerc became ill soon after we left Naples. On the third day he was very ill. He called me and said, \"Promise me something. It is very important.\" I promised. \"After my death, you will become captain. Go to Elba and ask for Marshal Bertrand. Give him this letter, and he will give you another letter. He will tell you where to take it. \"That is what Captain Leclerc said.\'\n\n\'And what did you do then?\' the judge asked.\n\n\'I agreed. Leclerc was dying. On a ship, the last request of an officer is an order. I reached Elba and I went on shore alone. I gave the letter to Marshal Bertrand. He gave me a letter to take to a person in Paris. I came here, visited Mercedes and prepared for my wedding. I am going to Paris tomorrow.\'\n\n\'Ah,\' said Villefort. \'Perhaps you were unwise, but you followed the last orders of your captain. Give me the letter that you brought from Elba. Promise to see me again if I call you. You can go back to your friends now.\'\n\n\'I am free, then?\' said Dantes happily.\n\n\'Yes, but first give me the letter.\'\n\n\'You have it already. The soldiers took it with some other letters. They are on the table.\'\n\n\'Stop,\' said Villefort, as Dantes took his hat. \'Whose name and address are on the letter?\'\n\n\'Noirtier, Heron Road, Paris.\'\n\nVillefort\'s face went white, and he looked afraid. \'Noirtier!\' he said in a weak voice. \'Noirtier!\'\n\n\'Yes. Do you know him?\'\n\n\'No,\' replied Villefort. \'I am a true follower of the king. I don\'t know men who want to destroy him.\'\n\n\'Noirtier wants to destroy the king?\' Dantes began to feel afraid. \'I told you - I didn\'t read the letter. I don\'t know what it says.\'\n\n\'Yes, but you saw the name on the envelope.\'\n\n\'Of course, I read the name. I had to give it to Noirtier.\'\n\n\'Did you show this letter to anyone?\' asked Villefort.\n\n\'No. I didn\'t show it to anyone. I promise you.\' Dantes looked at Villefort\'s face and was afraid.\n\nVillefort read the letter, then he covered his face with his hands. \'Oh!\' the judge thought. \'Does he know what is in this letter? Does he know my real name? Does he know that Noirtier is my father? If he knows this, then I am in danger!\' He looked closely at Dantes. Then he said, \'You cannot leave now. You must stay here for some time. I will try to make your stay as short as possible. The only thing against you is this letter.\' He took the letter from the table, and went to the fire. \'Look, I am burning it.\'\n\n\'Oh,\' cried Dantes, \'you are very kind.\'\n\n\'Listen,\' said Villefort. \'You know that I will help you. You will stay here until this evening. Don\'t answer any questions, don\'t say a word about this letter, and don\'t say the name of Noirtier.\'\n\n\'I promise.\'\n\nVillefort called out, and a soldier came into the room.\n\n\'Follow this soldier,\' Villefort told Dantes.\n\nThe door closed and Villefort fell into a chair. \'Oh, my father.

Every November he visits London. His old friend – Henry – has a small flat there. Marcel loves London. The beautiful buildings…the big black taxis…the museums and shops. He loves Paris, but he loves London too.\n\nThis story is about one of Marcel’s November holidays. It starts at three o’clock on Tuesday afternoon.

After tomorrow he’s going to be famous, too!’\n\n‘Famous?!’ Marcel looks at his English friend. ‘Why?’\n\n‘It’s a very interesting story,’ Henry says. ‘He has some letters. They were under the floor of an old woman’s house in Oxford.’\n\n‘And…?’ Marcel says.\n\n‘And they’re from Shakespeare to his son,’ Henry says.\n\n‘Shakespeare!’\n\n‘Yes.’ Henry smiles. ‘Shakespeare.

(12501, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 1\n\nThe Ship Comes Home\n\nOn 24th February 1815 the ship Pharaoh came in to Marseilles. A man on the shore jumped into a boat and went out to the ship.\n\nA young man, about twenty years old, looked over the side of the ship. He seemed to be the captain. He was the type of man who meets danger without fear.\n\n\'Oh! Is it you, Dantes?\' cried the man in the boat. \'What has happened?\'\n\n\'A very sad thing, Mr Morrel,\' replied the young man. \'When our ship was near Civitavecchia, we lost our brave Captain Leclerc.\'\n\nHe turned to his men and gave a quick order. Then he turned again to Morrel. The Pharaoh was Morrel\'s ship, and Edmond Dantes was First Officer.\n\n\'We will all die one day, Edmond,\' said Morrel. \'The goods-?\'\n\n\'They are safe, Mr Morrel. Now, come on board. Here is Danglars. He does all the buying and selling. I must look after my ship.\'\n\nMorrel climbed quickly onto the ship and met Danglars. Danglars was about twenty-five years old. Nobody on the Pharaoh liked him.\n\n\'Well, Mr Morrel,\' said Danglars. \'You heard about the sad death of Captain Leclerc?\'\n\n\'Yes. He was a brave and good man.\'\n\n\'And a good seaman. He was old and wise, a good ship\'s captain for Morrel and Son,\' replied Danglars.\n\n\'A young man can be a good captain, too,\' Morrel said. \'Look at our friend Edmond. He works well.\'\n\n\'Yes,\' said Danglars. He looked at Dantes. He did not like him. \'Yes, he is young and he is very sure of himself. When the captain died, we had to take orders from him. And as a result, we lost a day and a half at the island of Elba. We needed to come straight to Marseilles.\'\n\n\'He has to take the captain\'s place,\' said Morrel. \'He is the First Officer. But it was wrong to stop at Elba. Was the ship unsafe? Did you need to work on it?\'\n\n\'There was nothing wrong with the ship. We stopped at Elba and went on shore. It was a holiday, not work!\'\n\n\'Dantes,\' the shipowner called. \'Come here, please.\'\n\n\'In a minute, Mr Morrel,\' answered Dantes. He gave an order to his men. When the ship was safely tied up, Dantes came towards Morrel. \'The ship is now ready,\' he said. \'Can I help you, sir?\'\n\nDanglars took a few steps back. \'Why did you stop at the island of Elba?\' asked Morrel.\n\n\'I don\'t know, Mr Morrel. It was Captain Leclerc\'s last order. He gave me a letter for Marshal Bertrand.\'\n\nMorrel took Dantes arm and pulled him close. \'And how is Napoleon?\' he said quietly.\n\n\'He seemed very well.\'\n\n\'You spoke to him?\'\n\n\'No, he spoke to me,\' said Dantes. \'He asked: \"When did you leave Marseilles? What goods are on board?\" He was very interested. Perhaps he wanted to buy the ship. \"I am only the First Officer,\" I said. \"The ship belongs to Morrel and Son\"\n\n\"Ah!\" he said, \"I know them. The Morrels have owned ships for many years. But there was a Morrel who was a soldier. He fought with me at Valence.\"\n\n\'True!\' cried Morrel, happily. \'That was Policar Morrel, my uncle. He was a great soldier, a captain. Dantes, my uncle will be very happy about Napoleon. It will bring fire into the old soldier\'s eyes. You were right to stop at Elba, Dantes. But don\'t tell people about the letter for Marshal Bertrand, and about Napoleon. You will get into trouble.\'\n\n\'Why?\' asked Dantes. \'I don\'t know what was in the letter. Napoleon only asked me simple questions. Anyone can answer questions like those.\'\n\n\'My dear Dantes,\' said the owner, \'are you now free?\'\n\n\'Yes, Mr Morrel,\' Dantes replied.\n\n\'Can you come and have dinner with me?\'\n\n\'Thank you, Mr Morrel. But I must visit my father first.\'\n\n\'Visit your father, and then come to my house.\'\n\n\'Thank you again, Mr Morrel. But there is another person that I must see.\'\n\n\'True, Dantes. I forgot. Of course - the beautiful Mercedes. She came to see me three times. She wanted news about the Pharaoh.\'\n\n\'She has promised to marry me,\' the young seaman said.\n\n\'My dear Edmond,\' said the owner, \'that is very good news. Now hurry away to see your father.\'\n\n\'Thank you, Mr Morrel. I have a question. Can I leave the ship for fourteen days?\'\n\n\'To get married?\' Morrel asked.\n\n\'Yes, first. And then I want to go to Paris.\'\n\n\'Yes, of course, Dantes. But come back again in one month. The Pharaoh can\'t sail without her captain.\'\n\n\'Without her captain!\' cried Dantes. His eyes were bright and he was very happy. \'Are you really going to make me captain of the Pharaoh? Oh, Mr Morrel! I thank you for my father and for Mercedes.\'\n\n\'Good, Edmond. Go to your father, go and see Mercedes, and then come to see me.\'\n\n\'Shall I take you to the shore with me?\' Dantes asked.\n\n\'No, thank you. I\'ll stay and do some work with Danglars. Were you pleased with him on this journey?\'\n\n\'Do you mean, \"Is Danglars a good friend?\" No, we aren\'t friends. We disagreed one day near the island of Monte Cristo, and he doesn\'t like me. But he works well. I can say nothing against him.\'\n\nThe shipowner watched Dantes until he reached the shore. Danglars stood on the ship behind Morrel. He also watched the young man as he went away. But he did not look kindly at Dantes.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12500, 11701),
(12503, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 2\n\nFather and Son\n\nDantes turned into a narrow street and went into a small house.\n\n\'My dear Edmond,\' cried his father. \'My boy, my son! You are here in Marseilles! Tell me all your news.\'\n\n\'I have some sad news. The good Captain Leclerc is dead. But I am now captain of the Pharaoh! Just think! I am only twenty years old and the captain of a great ship. I will earn good money. I can buy you a new house. What is the matter, father? Aren\'t you well?\'\n\n\'It is nothing,\' his father said.\n\n\'You need food and a drink. Where will I find food and drink for you?\'\n\n\'There is nothing in the house,\' answered the old man. \'But I don\'t need anything, because you are here.\'\n\n\'When I left, three months ago, I gave you plenty of money,\' Dantes said.\n\n\'Yes. But I paid some money back to our friend Caderousse. He asked me for it.\'\n\n\'But you gave Caderousse more than half of the money! Why did you do that? Here, father, take this and send for some food.\' Edmond put all his money on the table.\n\n\'No, no,\' said the old man. \'I don\'t need all that money. But here comes Caderousse. He knows that you are home. He wants to welcome you.\'\n\n\'Hello! You have returned, Edmond?\' Caderousse said.\n\n\'Yes, neighbour,\' replied Dantes. He tried to hide his real feelings. \'I am ready to help you in any way.\'\n\n\'You are rich now,\' said Caderousse, looking hungrily at the money on the table.\n\n\'Oh that,\' said Dantes. \'That is my father\'s money. But of course, you are our neighbour. If you want money, we will lend it to you.\'\n\n\'Thank you, but I don\'t need anything. I met my friend Danglars. So I heard that you were here. I wanted to see you.\'\n\n\'Good Caderousse!\' said the old man. \'He is a great friend to us.\'\n\nThere was an ugly look on Caderousse\'s face. \'Well, Morrel is pleased with you,\' he said. \'Are you hoping to be the next captain of the Pharaoh?\'\n\n\'Yes. I believe that I will be the next captain. But, dear father, I must leave you. Now I must visit another person in the town.\'\n\n\'Go, my dear boy. And God protect your wife.\'\n\n\'His wife!\' said Caderousse. \'She isn\'t his wife yet. Mercedes is a fine girl, and fine girls have plenty of young men. But, you will be captain of the Pharaoh, so-\'\n\n\'My opinion of women - and of Mercedes - is better than yours,\' Dantes said. \'I know that she will always love me.\'\n\nEdmond left the house, and Caderousse joined Danglars. The seaman was waiting for him at the corner.\n\n\'He isn\'t captain yet,\' said Danglars quietly. \'We can stop him. Let\'s go. We will stop at \"La Reserve\" and drink a glass of wine there.\'\n\n\'Right, then,\' Caderousse said. \'But you must pay for the drink.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12502, 11701),

In a house about a hundred metres away, a young girl was at the window. Her hair was as black as night, and her eyes were as dark and wonderful as the shadow of a forest.\n\n\'Mercedes!\' a voice shouted happily outside the house. \'Mercedes!\'\n\n\'Ah!\' cried the girl. And she ran to the door and opened it. \'Here, Edmond, here I am!\'\n\nEdmond took Mercedes in his arms. The golden sunshine of Marseilles shone on them. They were together, the only two people in the world.\n\nEdmond and Mercedes walked past \'La Reserve\'. Caderousse and Danglars were still there.\n\n\'Hey, Edmond!\' cried Caderousse. He got up from his seat. \'Are you too proud to speak to your friends?\'\n\n\'No, my dear man!\' Dantes replied. \'I am not proud, but I am happy. I was thinking about Mercedes.\'\n\n\'When is the wedding?\' asked Danglars.\n\n\'Soon - tomorrow or the next day, here at \"La Reserve\". We hope that you and Caderousse will be there.\'\n\n\'Tomorrow or the next day! You are in a hurry, captain,\' said Danglars.\n\n\'I am not a captain yet, Danglars,\' said Dantes. \'But, yes, we are in a hurry because I must go to Paris.\'\n\n\'To Paris! Do you have business there?\'\n\n\'It is not my business. Captain Leclerc asked me to finish some work for him.\'\n\n\'Yes, yes, I understand,\' said Danglars. And he added, speaking to himself, \'To Paris - he is taking Marshal Bertrand\'s letter there. Ah!\n\nI have an idea. Dantes, my friend, you are not captain of the Pharaoh yet!\' He turned towards Edmond. \'A good journey!\' he cried.\n\n\'Thank you, my friend,\' said Edmond. And the two lovers continued on their happy path.\n\n\'Boy,\' shouted Danglars, \'bring me a pen and paper.\'\n\n\'It is a strange thought,\' said Caderousse. \'You can kill a man with a knife, but you can also kill him with that pen!\'\n\n\'I will tell you what I am going to do,\' said Danglars. \'Dantes has just returned from a journey. He stopped at the island of Elba. We are going to send a letter to an officer of the government. We will write that Dantes is working for Napoleon. He wants to bring Napoleon back as ruler of France.\'\n\nDanglars wrote, using his left hand:\n\nA friend of the king has information for the king\'s officers. Edmond Dantes, of the ship Pharaoh, brought a letter from Elba to the followers of Napoleon in Paris. You will find the letter in his coat, or at his father\'s house, or in his room on the ship.\n\nHe put the letter in an envelope and wrote a name on it: Villefort.\n\n\'So, I have done it,\' Danglars said.\n\n\'Yes, you have done it,\' said Caderousse. \'But it is a dirty piece of work.\' He put out his hand to take the letter.\n\n***\n\nThe cooks at \'La Reserve\' prepared a wonderful meal for the wedding. Many of the men from the Pharaoh were there, and other friends of Dantes.\n\n\'Shall we start?\' asked the sweet silvery voice of Mercedes. \'We must go to the church.\'\n\nEveryone in the party stood up and began to form a line.\n\nSuddenly, there was a loud noise. A man knocked on the door and shouted, \'Open this door, in the name of the law!\'\n\nAn officer came in. There were four soldiers with him.\n\n\'Where is Edmond Dantes?\'\n\n\'That is my name,\' said Edmond. \'Why?\'\n\n\'I can\'t tell you. Someone will tell you the reason later.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be afraid, my good friends,\' said Dantes. \'They are making a mistake. That is all, I am sure.\'\n\nDantes went into the courtyard with the soldiers.\n\n\'God go with you, my dearest,\' cried Mercedes.\n\n\'And with you, sweet Mercedes. We shall soon meet again.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12504, 11701),
(12508, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 5\n\nThe Prison\n\nThe soldier took Dantes to a small room. Then, at about ten o\'clock, an officer and four soldiers took him through the streets to the shore. They put Dantes in a boat. Then they watched him as the boat moved away.\n\n\'What is happening?\' Edmond thought wildly. \'The judge was kind to me. He told me not to be afraid. He only told me not to say the name Noirtier. And he destroyed the letter in front of me.\'\n\nDantes looked into the darkness. They were going out to sea. They were sailing away from everything that he loved. He turned to the nearest soldier.\n\n\'Friend,\' he said, \'please tell me where we are going. I am Edmond Dantes, a seaman, and a man who loves God and the king. Tell me where we are going.\'\n\n\'You were born in Marseilles and you are a seaman. But you don\'t know where you are going? Look!\'\n\nDantes stood up and looked in front of the boat. A hundred metres away, he saw the black and frightening shape of the rock where the Chateau d\'lf stands. The prison was about 300 years old. \'People tell many strange stories about this place,\' Dantes thought. \'Prisoners go there and never return. Is this the end of all hope?\'\n\n\'I am not going to be a prisoner there!\' cried Dantes. \'Only important prisoners, enemies of the king, go there! Mr Villefort promised me-\'\n\n\'Mr Villefort told us to take you to the Chateau d\'If.\'\n\nThe boat reached the shore. A soldier jumped out, took Dantes arms and pushed him up some steps. He passed through a door and the door closed behind him.\n\nHe was in a courtyard with high walls on all sides. He heard the feet of soldiers, walking around outside.\n\n\'Where is the prisoner?\' a voice said. \'Follow me.\'\n\nDantes followed. The man took him to a room which was almost under the ground.\n\n\'This is your room for tonight,\' the man said. \'It is late, and the governor is asleep. Tomorrow, perhaps, he will send you to another place. There is bread and water and some dry grass to sleep on. Good night.\'\n\nThe man left quickly and took away his lamp. Dantes was alone in the darkness and the silence.\n\n***\n\nAt the first light of day, the guard returned. Dantes was standing in the same place, just inside the door. The man touched Dantes on the arm and asked, \'Haven\'t you slept?\'\n\n\'I don\'t know,\' Dantes answered.\n\nThe guard looked at him. \'Are you hungry?\'\n\n\'I don\'t know.\'\n\n\'Do you want anything?\'\n\n\'I want to see the governor.\'\n\nThe guard gave a short laugh, and left the room. The door closed. Dantes threw himself on the floor. \'What is happening?\' he cried. \'Why am I in this place?\'\n\nThe day passed. Dantes did not eat. He walked round and round the small room.\n\nThe next morning, the guard came back again. \'Prisoner,\' he said, \'are you feeling better today?\'\n\nDantes did not answer.\n\n\'Be brave, man. Can I get you anything?\' the guard asked.\n\n\'I want to see the governor.\'\n\n\'That is not possible,\' the guard said.\n\n\'What can I do, then?\' Dantes asked.\n\n\'You can have better food - if you pay for it - and books. And you can walk around in the courtyard.\'\n\n\'I don\'t want books. This food is all right. And I don\'t want to walk around. I want to see the governor.\'\n\n\'You can\'t. Don\'t ask to see him. I will always say no. You will go crazy.\'\n\n\'You think so?\'\n\n\'I know it. There is a man in this prison - he was in this room before you. \"If you help me, I will give you a lot of treasure,\" he told the governor. He was put in a room underground two years ago.\'\n\n\'Listen. I am not crazy,\' Dantes said. \'And I must see the governor.\'\n\n\'Oh, ho!\' cried the guard, stepping back. \'You are going crazy. We will have trouble with you. But there are plenty of places underground.\'\n\nHe went out. A few minutes later, he returned with four soldiers.\n\n\'The governor has sent orders,\' he said. He turned to the soldiers. \'This prisoner is crazy. Put him underground.\'\n\nThe soldiers took Dantes\' arms. He went quietly. They walked down fifteen steps. Then the soldiers opened the door of a room, and threw Dantes inside.\n\nThe door closed, and Dantes walked around. He held his hands out until he touched the wall. Then he sat down in a corner. It was very dark and he could see nothing.\n\n\'The guard is right,\' he thought. \'This place will make me completely crazy.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12507, 11701),

The chief officer of prisons visited the prisoners\' rooms. \'Is the food good?\' he asked the prisoners. \'Do you want anything?\'\n\n\'The food is very bad, and we want to be free,\' they all replied.\n\nThe officer laughed and turned to the governor. \'Why do we come here? We always hear the same thing. \"The food is bad. I have done nothing wrong. I want to be free.\" Are there any other prisoners?\'\n\n\'Yes, there are the crazy prisoners. We keep them underground. They are a danger to other people.\'\n\n\'Let\'s visit them. I must see them all.\'\n\nTwo soldiers took the officer down the steps. The air smelled bad. The darkness was full of the smell of death.\n\n\'Oh!\' cried the officer. \'Who can live here?\'\n\n\'Very bad men. We must watch them very carefully.\'\n\nThis was the officer\'s first visit.\n\n\'Prisoner number 34. Let\'s visit this one first,\' he said.\n\nDantes was sitting in the corner of his room. He looked up and saw the stranger with two soldiers.\n\n\'This is an important officer,\' he thought. He jumped up to meet him, but the soldiers pushed him back.\n\n\'The officer thinks that I am crazy,\' Dantes thought. He looked at the officer. He tried to make his voice quiet and calm. \'I only want to know what is going to happen to me. Why am I here? Give me your permission to see a judge.\'\n\n\'Perhaps,\' said the chief officer. Then, turning to the governor, he said, \'Show me your books. What is this man\'s crime?\'\n\n\'I know that you can\'t free me,\' said Dantes. \'But tell me, please, that there is hope.\'\n\n\'I can\'t tell you that. I can only promise to ask about the matter. Who gave orders for you to come to the prison?\'\n\n\'Mr Villefort.\'\n\n\'Does he have a reason to be your enemy?\'\n\n\'No. He was very kind to me,\' Dantes said.\n\n\'Then I can believe what he writes about you in the prison\'s book?\'\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\nThe officer left the room and closed the door. But he left something in the room - hope.\n\nThe officer kept his promise to Dantes. He looked in the prison book and found:\n\n\nEDMOND DANTES: A dangerous man. He helped\n\nNapoleon return from Elba. Watch him carefully.\n\n\n\'I can\'t help this prisoner,\' the chief officer thought. He wrote in the book:\n\nDo nothing.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12509, 11701),

Dantes began to think that the officer\'s visit was only a dream.\n\nSuddenly, one evening, at about nine o\'clock, Edmond heard a sound in the wall next to his bed. He listened. \'Perhaps this is only a dream, too,\' he thought. But he heard the sound again. He heard something fall - and then silence.\n\nSome hours later, he heard the noise again, nearer and more clearly. Edmond listened. \'I know what that sound is,\' he thought. \'A prisoner is trying to escape.\'\n\nEdmond wanted to help. He moved his bed, then he looked round the room for a sharp tool. The only things in the room were a bed, a chair, a table, and a water pot. \'I will break the water pot and use one of the sharp pieces,\' he thought.\n\nHe threw the pot on the floor, and it broke into pieces. He hid two or three pointed bits in his bed.\n\nThe next morning, the guard came into the room.\n\n\'The water pot fell from my hands when I was drinking,\' Dantes said. The man was angry with him for his carelessness, but he brought another pot. He did not take away the broken pieces of the old one.\n\nDantes started to work. The stone wall was old and soft, and it broke into small pieces easily. At last he pulled a stone out of the wall. It left a hole half a metre wide. He carefully carried all the small pieces of stone into the corners of the room, and covered them with earth. He put back the big stone, and placed his bed in front of the hole.\n\nLater, the guard came with his evening meal. When the man left the room, Dantes started to work again. He worked all night, making a deep hole in the wall. Then he stopped.\n\n\'What is this?\' he cried. \'I can\'t cut through it or move it.\'\n\nIt was a great piece of wood. Dantes could not make the hole deeper.\n\n\'Oh, my God, my God!\' he cried. \'I want to die. I have lost all hope.\'\n\n\'Who is the man who can talk at the same time about God and about hopelessness?\' said a voice under the earth.\n\nEdmond got up on his knees. \'Ah!\' he said. \'A voice - the voice of a man! In the name of God, speak again!\'\n\n\'Who are you?\' said the voice.\n\n\'An unhappy prisoner.\'\n\n\'Why are you in prison?\'\n\n\'I did nothing wrong,\' Dantes replied. \'They say that I tried to help Napoleon. He wanted to return to France.\'\n\n\'To return to France! Where is he now, then?\'\n\n\'They sent him to the island of Elba in 1814. Don\'t you know that? When did you come here?\'\n\n\'In 1811.\'\n\n\'Four years before me!\'\n\n\'Don\'t do any more work,\' said the voice. \'Just tell me - how high up are you?\'\n\n\'At the same height as the floor of my room,\' Dantes said.\n\n\'What is behind the door of your room?\'\n\n\'A narrow room and then the courtyard.\'\n\n\'Oh! That is bad,\' the voice said. \'My plan is wrong. I wanted to break through to the outside wall of the prison.\'\n\n\'And then?\'\n\n\'And then throw myself into the sea and swim to one of the islands near here. Cover the opening of the hole in the wall. Do it carefully. Stop working on the hole. Wait until you hear from me again.\'\n\n\'Tell me who you are,\' cried Edmond.\n\n\'I am - I am Number 27.\'\n\n\'Why don\'t you tell me your name?\'\n\nEdmond heard a quiet laugh. \'Oh!\' he cried. \'Please - please don\'t leave me alone. I promise that I won\'t say a word to the guards.\'\n\n\'I will talk to you again,\' said the voice. \'Tomorrow.\'\n\nEdmond closed the opening in the wall, carefully hid the bits of stone and put his bed back in its place.\n\nThe next morning, when he moved his bed away from the wall, he heard a sound. He got down on his knees.\n\n\'Is it you?\' he said. \'I am here.\'\n\nSoon after that, part of the floor of Dantes\' room fell away. Stones and earth fell down into the opening. Then, at the bottom of the hole, Dantes saw the arms and head of a man. The man climbed up into the room.\n\nDantes reached his hands out to his new friend. He was a small man, and his hair was white. His eyes were dark, and he had a long beard. He was not strong.\n\n\'You seem very happy to see me!\' he said to Dantes. \'Your happiness touches my heart.\'\n\nBut Dantes knew that the man was very sad. \'You worked hard to escape,\' he said, \'but you haven\'t reached the outside of the prison. This is just another room. But there are three other sides to the room. Do you know what is outside those walls?\'\n\n\'One wall is built against the rock. One is against the lower part of the governor\'s house. If we get out there, the guards will catch us. And this side faces - where?\'\n\nThey looked at the third side of the room. There was a small window high up in the wall, with three strong bars across it.\n\nThe man pulled the table across the room and put it under the window. \'Climb on the table,\' he said to Dantes. \'Put your back against the wall, and join your hands in front of your body.\'\n\nThen prisoner Number 27 jumped up on to the table, and from there on to Dantes hands and from them onto Dantes shoulders. He put his head through the top bars of the window, then pulled his head back quickly. Finally he said, \'I thought so.\' He got down quickly and easily.\n\n\'He moves as quickly as a young man,\' Dantes thought.\n\n\'This side of your room,\' said Number 27, \'faces an open pathway. A soldier guards it day and night. It is not possible to escape through any of these walls.\'\n\nDantes looked at the man. \'You really want to escape,\' he thought. \'And now you know that you can\'t. So why are you so calm?\' Then he said, \'Tell me, please - who are you?\'\n\n\'My name is Faria,\' the other man replied. \'I came to the Chateau d\'If in the year 1811. Before that, I was in the prison of Fenestrelle for three years.\'\n\n\'But why are you here?\'\n\n\'As you know, there are a number of small countries in Italy. Each country has a ruler. I wanted to make Italy one great country under one great king. My chosen king tried to destroy me. And now Italy will never be one country. Napoleon tried to make it one country, but he did not complete his work. Poor Italy.\' The old man\'s voice was very sad.\n\n\'Can I see your secret path behind the wall?\' Dantes asked.\n\n\'Follow me,\' said Faria, and he went into the deep hole in the wall.

Faria pulled up a stone in the floor, and they climbed into his room.\n\nDantes looked around. \'There is one thing that I still don\'t understand,\' he said. \'How do you do so much work?\'\n\n\'I work all night.\'\n\n\'At night? Do you have cat\'s eyes? Can you see in the dark?\'\n\n\'No, of course not. But God has given man a mind. With it, we can make what we need. I made a lamp for myself. I get the oil from my food, and it burns very well.\'\n\nThey sat and talked. Faria\'s words were clever and wise. Sometimes Dantes could not understand them.\n\n\'You are very wise. Will you teach me ?\' Dantes asked. \'I don\'t want you to get tired of me. A clever person doesn\'t want to talk to a person who knows nothing. Teach me, and then the hours will pass more quickly for you.\'\n\nDantes learned new ideas from Faria very quickly and easily. He learned about the history of the world, and the English language, and many other things.\n\n***\n\nTime passed. Dantes was much happier, but Faria\'s health was not good. One day, Faria was in Edmond\'s room. Edmond was working on the secret path between their rooms. Suddenly, Edmond heard Faria cry out in pain. He hurried to him, and found him in the middle of the room. His face was as white as death.\n\n\'What is the matter?\' cried Dantes.\n\n\'Quick!\' replied Faria. \'Listen to me.\'\n\nDantes looked at Faria\'s face and was afraid. Faria\'s eyes were dark, and there were deep blue circles round them. His skin was very pale.\n\n\'Listen,\' said Faria. \'I have a terrible illness. I was ill before I came to the prison. Help me back to my room. Take out one of the feet which hold up my bed. There is a small bottle of red liquid in the hole.\'\n\nDantes acted quickly. He pulled the old man down into the underground path, and took him back to his room. Then he helped Faria on to the bed.\n\n\'Thank you,\' the poor man said. He was very cold now. \'Now I must tell you about this illness. When it reaches its worst point - and not before - I pour a little of the liquid into my mouth.\'\n\nHe stopped talking. The frightening greyness of death passed over his face. Dantes waited. Then he thought, \'My friend is nearly dead.\' He took Faria\'s knife, broke open the bottle and poured a little of the liquid into Faria\'s mouth. Then he waited again. \'Will my friend die?\' he cried.\n\nOne hour passed, and there was no change. Then at last a little colour came into Faria\'s face. The wide-open eyes showed some life. Faria could not speak, but he pointed to the door. Dantes listened, and heard the steps of the guard. \'He mustn\'t find me here!\' he thought.\n\nThe young man ran to the opening of the underground path and hurried to his room. Just after he reached it, the guard came in with food. He saw his prisoner sitting, as usual, on the side of his bed.\n\nAfter the guard left, Dantes hurried back to Faria\'s room. He lifted up the stone, and was soon next to the sick man\'s bed. Faria was a little better, but he was still very weak.\n\n\'Don\'t lose hope,\' said Dantes. \'You will soon be strong again.\' He sat down on the bed next to Faria and held the old man\'s cold hands.\n\n\'No,\' said Faria. \'My first illness lasted for only half an hour. When it ended, I got up from my bed without help. Now I can\'t move my right arm or leg, and there is a pain in my head. Next time, the illness will kill me.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12513, 11701);

(12516, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 9\n\nThe Story of the Treasure\n\nThe next morning, Dantes returned to Faria\'s room. Faria looked a little better. He showed Dantes a small piece of paper. Half of it was burnt away.\n\nEdmond said, \'I can\'t see anything except broken lines and words.\'\n\n\'I know what the words mean,\' said Faria. \'But first I will tell you the story of this paper. I was the friend and helper of Prince Spada, the last of the princes of that name. I was very happy with him. A long time ago, his family was very rich - people often say, \"as rich as a Spada\" - but my friend, Prince Spada, had very little money. He told me about another Spada; this man lived - and died - at the time of Cesare Borgia.\n\n\'Cesare Borgia needed money for his wars, but the country was very poor. Finally he thought of a plan. He asked two famous rich men, Rospigliosi and Spada, to dinner. Rospigliosi was very pleased, but Spada was a wise man. \"Cesare Borgia wants my money,\" he thought. \"He will kill me.\" He wrote a note, then he went to the dinner. There was death in the glass of wine in front of him. \"If I don\'t drink the wine, Borgia will kill me in another way,\" he thought. So Spada drank - and died.\n\n\'Cesare Borgia took all the dead man\'s papers, and the last letter that Spada wrote before the dinner. This said:\n\n\'I give everything to my brother\'s child- all my money and all my books. Tell him to keep the prayer book with the gold corners carefully. It will help him to remember his uncle.\'\n\n\'Cesare looked everywhere. There were some gold cups and a little money - very little - and he took those. But he could not find the treasure of the Spadas.\n\n\'Years passed. The famous prayer book stayed in the family, and my friend, the Prince, now owned it. Like many people before me, I looked through all the family papers - through rooms full of papers. Where was the treasure of the Spadas? I found nothing. I read the history of the Borgia family. Cesare Borgia took all the Rospigliosis\' money - true - but I found no information about the Spada treasure. I was sure that the treasure was still hidden somewhere.\n\n\'My friend died and left everything to me. He asked me to write a history of the Spada family.\'\n\n\'In 1807, a month before I became a prisoner, I was reading some papers. I fell asleep. It was evening when I woke up. The only light was from the fire. I felt for a piece of paper. I wanted to get a light for the lamp from the fire. I didn\'t want to burn any important papers, but I remembered a piece of plain white paper in the prayer book. I took it and put a corner in the fire.\'\n\n\'The fire began to burn the paper. Suddenly, I saw yellow writing! I quickly put out the fire, and looked at the paper. There were words on it. You could only read them when the paper was hot. I burnt a lot of the paper, but the last piece is in your hands.\'\n\nDantes looked again at the yellow writing.\n\n\'And now,\' said Faria, \'look at this.\' He gave Dantes a second piece of paper with broken lines of writing on it. \'Put the two pieces together.\'\n\n\'Yes,\' Dantes said. \'I understand. But the writing on the second piece is different.\'\n\n\'It is my writing,\' said Faria. \'I thought about it and completed the old paper. When I understood the words, I left immediately. But the government was afraid of me. When I went on board the ship, soldiers took me prisoner.\'\n\nFaria looked at Dantes. \'And now, my dear man,\' he said, \'you know as much as I do. If we ever escape together, half this treasure is yours. If I die here, all of the treasure is yours. You are my son. You were born to me in this prison. God sent you to help a sad old prisoner.\'\n\n\'Thank you,\' said the young man to Faria. \'But we will never have the treasure, because we won\'t leave this prison. My real treasure is your teaching and your wise words.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12515, 11701),
(12518, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 10\n\nThe Death of Faria\n\nThe days passed. Faria talked about his treasure, and he thought about ways of escape for his young friend.\n\n\'I am afraid that I will lose the letter,\' he said to Dantes.\' Learn it - every word.\' Then he burnt the paper.\n\nFaria could not use his arm and leg, but his words and thoughts were clear. He continued to teach Dantes history and English and other subjects. He also taught him to make things - a useful skill for a prisoner. They were always busy. Dantes worked hard; he wanted to forget the past.\n\n***\n\nOne night, Edmond woke up suddenly. He heard a weak voice call his name through the darkness. He moved his bed, took out the stone, and hurried along the underground path. The other end of it was open. It was dark, but he saw the old, white-faced man holding on to the end of his bed in great pain.\n\n\'Ah, my dear friend,\' said Faria. \'You understand, don\'t you? You know that the time has come.\'\n\n\'Don\'t say that!\' cried Dantes. \'I have saved you once. I will save you again.\'\n\nHe quickly lifted up the foot of the bed and took out the little bottle. There was still some red liquid in it. \'Look,\' he cried. \'There is still some in here. Tell me what to do.\'\n\n\'There is no hope,\' Faria replied. \'But you can try to save my life. Do the same thing, but don\'t wait too long. If I don\'t get better, pour the rest into my mouth. Now put me on my bed.\'\n\nEdmond took the old man in his arms and put him on the bed.\n\n\'Dear friend,\' said Faria, \'you are good to me. You bring me great happiness. If you escape, go to Monte Cristo. Take the treasure and enjoy it. God go with you!\'\n\nDantes waited, holding the bottle of liquid in his hand. When it seemed to be the right time, he poured a little of the liquid into Faria\'s mouth. Then he waited. He waited for ten minutes, half an hour. Then he put the bottle to Faria\'s mouth and poured in the rest of the liquid.\n\nFaria moved. His eyes opened. He gave a little cry. Then silence. Edmond sat with his hand on his friend\'s heart. The heart became weaker and weaker. And then the old man\'s body slowly went cold.\n\nDantes went down into the underground path and put back the stones behind him. He was lucky. A few minutes later, the guard arrived. He went first to Dantes\' room. Then he went on to Faria\'s room with his breakfast and some clothes.\n\n\'What is happening in my friend\'s room?\' Dantes thought. \'I must know.\' He went down the underground path and heard the guard\'s cries.\n\nOther guards came. \'Finally,\' one of them said, \'the old man has gone to look for his treasure. I hope that he has a good journey!\'\n\n\'And now we can prepare him for his grave,\' another man said. \'Put him in a simple bag of plain cloth. That is enough for a grave at the Chateau d\'If!\'\n\nThen there was silence.\n\n\'Perhaps they have gone away,\' Edmond thought. \'But I am not sure, so I can\'t go inside.\'\n\nAfter an hour he heard a noise. It was the governor, and there was someone with him.\n\n\'Yes,\' said an unknown voice, \'Faria is dead.\'\n\n\'I am sure that he is,\' the governor said. \'But by the rules of the prison, we must check.\'\n\nDantes heard more footsteps. People went in and out of the room. Then he heard someone pull a large piece of cloth along the floor. There was another sound from the bed when somebody put a heavy weight on it.\n\n\'In the evening,\' said the governor. \'At about ten or eleven.\'\n\n\'Shall we stay with the body?\'\n\n\'No. That isn\'t necessary. Lock the door.\'\n\nThe steps went away and the voices disappeared. Someone locked the door. Then there was silence, the deepest of all silences - the silence of death.\n\nDantes lifted the stone. He looked carefully round the room. There was nobody there. He went in.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12517, 11701),
(12520, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 11\n\nThe Grave of the Chateau d\'If\n\nOn the bed Dantes saw a long bag of dirty cloth. The body of his friend Faria lay inside it. \'Alone! I am alone again,\' Dantes thought. And then he stopped. He looked at the bag and a strange thought came to him. \'Only dead people leave this prison. I can take the place of the dead!\'\n\nThere was no time to think about it. Dantes opened the bag with Faria\'s knife. He took the body from the bag and carried it along the underground path to his own room. He laid the body on his bed and pulled the bedclothes over its head. Then he kissed the cold face and turned it to the wall.\n\n\'The guard will think that I am asleep,\' Dantes said to himself.\n\nHe returned to Faria\'s room, took off his clothes and hid them. Then he got inside the bag, and lay exactly like the dead body. \'I have made my plan,\' he thought. \'Will the men discover me when they carry the bag outside? Will they find a living man, not a dead body? If that happens, I will cut open the bag from top to bottom with the knife. Then I will escape. If they try to catch me, I will use the knife.\n\n\'Perhaps they will put me in the grave, and cover me with earth. It will be night. I only hope that the grave is not too deep.\'\n\nAnother thought came to him. \'When the guard brings my evening meal at seven o\'clock, will he notice Faria\'s body in my bed? But no, I am often in bed when the man comes. He just puts the food on the table and goes away again in silence. If he speaks to me this time, what will happen then? When he gets no answer, will he go to the bed?\'\n\nDantes waited for the cries of the guard. But the hours passed, and the prison was quiet. Finally, Edmond heard footsteps outside. He must be brave now, braver than ever before. The footsteps stopped outside the door.\n\n\'There are two of them,\' Dantes decided. He heard them put down some wood. \'They are going to carry the body on that,\' he thought.\n\nThe door opened. Through the cloth of the bag, he saw two shadows come to the ends of his bed. Another man stood at the door with the lamp.\n\n\'He was a thin old man, but he is heavy.\' One man was lifting up his head. The other man lifted his feet.\n\n\'Have you tied it on?\' the first speaker asked.\n\n\'Not yet - we don\'t want to carry unnecessary weight!\' the other man replied. \'I can do that when we get there.\'\n\n\"\'Tied it on.\" Tied what on?\' thought Dantes.\n\nThe men put the body on the piece of wood. Then they moved up the steps.\n\nSuddenly, Dantes felt the cold, fresh night air. The men walked about twenty metres, then stopped and put the body down. One of them went away. Dantes heard the sound of his shoes on the stone. \'Where am I?\' he asked himself.\n\n\'Here it is. I have found it.\'\n\nEdmond heard the man put a heavy weight on to the ground next to him. Then he tied the weight round Dantes feet.\n\n\'Is that tied carefully?\' asked the other man.\n\n\'Yes. It won\'t come off,\' was the answer.\n\nThe men lifted Dantes up again, and they began to walk. Now Dantes heard the sound of waves against the rocks.\n\n\'We are finally here,\' said one of the men.\n\n\'Don\'t stop yet,\' said the other man. \'You know very well that the last one fell on the rocks. Don\'t you remember that the governor was angry with us?\'\n\nThey went five or six more steps, then they lifted Dantes by his head and by his feet.\n\n\'One!\' said the men. \'Two! Three - and away!\'\n\nThey threw Dantes into the air. He was falling, falling. A heavy weight pulled him quickly down. Finally, with a great noise, he fell into the cold water. When he hit the water, he gave a cry. Then the water closed over him.\n\n\'They have thrown me into the sea!\' Dantes cried to himself. \'They tied a big stone to my feet. It is pulling me down to the bottom of the sea. This is the grave of the Chateau d\'If - the sea!\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12519, 11701),
(12522, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 12\n\nThe Young Amelia\n\nDantes was wise. He kept his mouth shut after that first cry of surprise. In his right hand he still held the knife. He quickly cut open the bag, got one arm out and then his body. The stone pulled him down and down, and he felt very weak. But he reached down and cut the stone free. Then he swam quickly to the top of the water, and the stone fell to the bottom of the sea.\n\nDantes felt the night air on his face. He began to swim under the water because he did not want the guards to see him.\n\nWhen he came up again, he was nearly a hundred metres from the prison. Above him, he saw a black and stormy sky. In front of him lay the great black sea. Behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the clouds, stood the Chateau d\'If. It was a large and terrible place. The rocks around it seemed to reach out to take him back. And on the highest rock there were two men holding a lamp.\n\n\'They are looking at the sea,\' Dantes thought. \'Perhaps they heard me shout.\' He went down again under the water and stayed there for a long time.\n\nWhen he came up again, he could not see the light. He began to swim out to sea. He swam for hours; he was trying to reach an island.\n\n\'In two or three hours,\' he thought, \'the guard will go into my room. He will find the body of my poor friend. He will look for me and not find me, and then he will call for help. The soldiers will discover the underground path. They will question the men who threw me into the sea. They will send boats of soldiers to find the escaped prisoner. Everyone will search for a hungry man without clothes. Soldiers will look for me in Marseilles, and the governor and his men will search for me on the sea. I am cold. I am hungry. I have lost my knife. Oh, my God! Help me - oh, help me!\'\n\nAfter Dantes said this prayer, he looked towards the Chateau d\'If. He saw a small ship, coming out from Marseilles. It was moving quickly out to sea.\n\nIt came near him. He shouted and waved his hand. The ship turned towards him, and let down a boat.\n\nThere were two men in the boat. Dantes began to swim to it, but he was too weak. He gave a cry, and one of the men in the boat shouted, \'Be strong! We are coming!\'\n\nDantes heard their words. A wave passed over him. He came up to the top of the water, and then he went down again. The water closed over his head. \'I am dying!\' he thought. Then someone caught him by the hair and pulled him up. After that, he heard and saw nothing.\n\nWhen Dantes opened his eyes, he was on board the ship. \'Where are we going?\' he thought. He looked out through a small window. \'We are leaving the Chateau d\'If behind!\'\n\nThe captain came to see him.\n\n\'I am a seaman, and I lost my ship in the storm,\' Dantes told him.\n\n\'You can stay on my ship,\' the captain said. \'But you will have to work.\' Suddenly, a loud noise rang across the waters. \'Hey! What is that?\' cried the captain.\n\n\'A prisoner has escaped from the Chateau d\'If,\' replied Dantes.\n\n\'Is he the escaped prisoner?\' the captain thought. He looked at Dantes. \'Does it matter? Even if it is him, he will be useful to us.\'\n\nThe ship was called the Young Amelia. It carried goods to quiet shores on dark nights. There were no customs officers in these places, so the captain did not pay money to the government for the goods.\n\nAt first the captain did not tell Dantes about his business. \'I do not know this man,\' he thought. \'Perhaps he is a government officer.\' But after some days, he started to like Dantes.\n\n***\n\nThe ship reached Livorno. Edmond asked a man there to shave him and cut his hair. When the job was finished, he asked for a mirror. He saw the changes in his face.\n\n\'When I went to the Chateau d\'If, my face was round and open. It was the face of a young and happy man,\' he said to himself. Now his face was longer. His mouth was harder and stronger. His eyes were deep and thoughtful, and his skin was whiter. Even his voice was softer and sadder.\n\n\'I don\'t know myself,\' he thought. \'I am a stranger.\'\n\nNext, he went to buy some clothes. Then, a changed man, he went back on board the Young Amelia.\n\nThe men of the Young Amelia worked hard for their captain. They spent very little time in Livorno. The captain wanted to get the goods out of the city quickly, and to take them to Corsica.\n\nThey sailed away. Edmond was happy on the open sea. \'I often dreamed about this in prison,\' he thought.\n\nEarly next morning, the captain found Dantes. The two men stood at the side of the ship, and looked at some great rocks. The sun shone in the sky and coloured the rocks a soft pink. It was the island of Monte Cristo.\n\n\'I can jump over the side of the ship,\' Dantes thought, \'and swim to the island in an hour. But if I do that, how will I get the treasure away? I must wait. I waited for years to be free. I can wait for a few months to be rich.\' He looked again at the island. \'Perhaps the treasure is only a dream, a dream of Faria\'s. But there was Prince Spada\'s letter. That seemed real.\' Dantes repeated the letter to himself from the beginning to the end; he remembered every word.\n\nNight came, and Edmond watched the island. It was beautiful with the colours of the evening, then slowly it hid itself in the darkness.\n\n\'How can I reach Monte Cristo and bring the treasure back safely? The treasure is mine. But I have no money for a small boat to get it.\'\n\nHe thought about this problem all the time.\n\n***\n\nThey returned from Corsica to Livorno. One evening, in Livorno, the captain asked Dantes to come to an important meeting. Edmond went with the captain to see other ships\' captains. They talked about a ship from Turkey which was carrying expensive cloth. They wanted to find a quiet place and meet this ship, buy the cloth and then take it to the coast of France.\n\n\'We need a quiet place where there are no customs officers,\' one man said. \'A place where nobody will see us.\'\n\n\'The best place is the island of Monte Cristo,\' said the captain of the Young Amelia. \'Nobody lives on the island, and no customs officers ever go there.\'\n\nThey decided to sail to Monte Cristo the next night.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12521, 11701),
(12524, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 13\n\nMonte Cristo\n\nAnd so, by a lucky accident, Dantes reached the island of Monte Cristo. The Young Amelia was first at the meeting place. Dantes was the first person to reach the shore.\n\nThe men knew the island well. Dantes questioned Jacopo, the man who saved him from the sea. \'Where shall we spend the night?\'\n\n\'On the ship, of course.\'\n\n\'I must find the place where Spada hid the treasure,\' Dantes thought. \'There is an opening somewhere -but where? Perhaps Spada hid it with stones, or perhaps it is now covered with trees and plants. But I must wait for the morning.\'\n\nJust then a boat arrived and came close to the shore. The business began. As he worked, Dantes worried. \'Did I say too much to Jacopo? Will the men learn about the treasure?\' No. His secret was still safe.\n\nNext morning, the men rested. When Dantes quietly walked away, nobody seemed surprised. He climbed high, until the men on the shore looked very small. Then he found a path that was cut by a stream between two walls of rock. He followed it. \'The treasure is near here,\' he thought.\n\nAs he went along the coast, he looked at everything carefully. \'These stones have marks on them. A man made these marks!\' He came to the twenty-first stone, and the marks stopped. But there was no opening, just one large rock. \'This rock is so big. I don\'t think anybody can move it! It is too heavy. I must start again.\' And he turned and went back to his friends.\n\nThe men on the shore were cooking a meal. They were sitting down to eat when they saw Dantes. He was jumping from rock to rock towards them. All eyes turned to him. But then they saw him fall! They all ran to him, but Jacopo reached him first.\n\nEdmond was not moving. \'Is he dead?\' Jacopo thought.\n\nAfter some time Dantes opened his eyes. \'My knee hurts very badly,\' he said, \'and my head and my legs feel heavy.\'\n\nThey wanted to carry him to the shore. But when they touched him, he gave a cry of pain. \'Don\'t move me!\' he cried.\n\n\'The pain is too great.\'\n\nHe did not want any food, but he told the other men to have their meal. \'I only need to rest,\' he said. \'When you return, I will feel better.\' The sailors went away.\n\nThey returned an hour later. \'He is not getting better,\' one of the sailors said. \'His pain seems to be worse.\'\n\n\'I must sail this morning,\' the captain said to Dantes. \'Won\'t you try to get up?\'\n\nDantes tried to stand up, but each time he fell back. With each fall he cried out with pain.\n\n\'He has broken his leg,\' the captain said in a low voice. \'But he is a very good man, and we can\'t leave him. We will try to carry him on board the ship.\'\n\n\'No,\' Dantes said. \'The pain is too bad. Don\'t move me. Leave me here.\'\n\n\'No,\' said the captain, \'we won\'t leave until evening. I don\'t want people to think that we left a good man like you on this empty island.\'\n\nBut Dantes told him to go. \'No, no,\' he said to the captain. \'I was stupid, and I must suffer for my mistake. Leave me a small amount of food and an axe. I will build myself a hut.\'\n\nThe captain turned towards his ship. It was waiting just off the shore, ready for sea. \'What shall we do?\' he asked. \'We can\'t leave you here; but we can\'t stay.\'\n\n\'Go. Please go,\' cried Dantes.\n\n\'We will be away for more than a week,\' the captain said. \'Then we will make a special journey to get you.\'\n\nDantes spoke again. \'If, in two or three days, you see a fishing boat, ask them to come here for me. I will pay them to take me to Livorno. If you don\'t meet a fishing boat, please come back for me.\'\n\n\'Listen, Captain,\' said Jacopo. \'I will stay with him.\'\n\n\'You will say goodbye to your part of the money from this business to stay with me?\'\n\n\'Yes,\' said Jacopo immediately.\n\nA strange look passed over Dantes face. He pressed Jacopo\'s hand. \'You are a good, kind-hearted friend,\' he said to Jacopo.\n\n\'God will love you for your kindness. But I don\'t want anyone to stay with me. I will be all right.\'\n\nThe men left the things that Edmond wanted. Then they went back to the ship. Two or three times they turned round and waved to him, and Edmond waved back.\n\n\'They are rough, dangerous men,\' Dantes said to himself, \'but they are good friends.\'\n\nHe pulled himself up carefully to the top of the rock. He watched the ship leave. Like a beautiful white bird, it sailed out over the sea.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12523, 11701),
(12526, 'The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas\n\nPart 14\n\nTreasure\n\nEdmond climbed carefully down from the rocks.\n\n\'I didn\'t really fall. I wanted the men to leave me here. I don\'t want to fall and hurt myself now!\' he thought.\n\nHe followed the line of marks on the stones again. They started from a small place on the shore. Only a small ship could land there. \'But Spada\'s boat landed here,\' Dantes said to himself. The marks ended at the large round rock.\n\n\'But,\' thought Edmond,\' how did Prince Spada lift this heavy rock into this place? Twenty men couldn\'t move a rock like this.\' Suddenly a thought came to him. \'They didn\'t lift this rock into its place - it fell here!\'\n\nHe jumped from the rock to look at the ground above it.\n\n\'Somebody cut a path here, and moved the rock down it. They put a large stone here to hold it in its place. Now the stone is almost hidden by the grass. But the rock does not fit perfectly. The holes are full of small stones and earth.\'\n\nDantes cut away these small stones at the top, and after ten minutes he put his arm into the hole. He took his axe and cut wood from a strong tree. Then he put one end of the wood into the hole and pulled on the other. The rock moved. Again he pulled. The rock moved from its place, and then fell back again. Dantes rested. He gave a last, strong pull. The rock fell down the hill into the sea.\n\nIn the place of the rock, Dantes saw a large square stone, with a ring in the centre of it. He felt weak, so he waited for a minute. Then he put the wood into the ring and lifted the stone. He saw steps going down into the darkness of an underground room.\n\nBut there was some light down there, and the air was fresh. Both the light and air came in through small holes in the rock above his head. Dantes looked into the corners of the underground room. There was nothing in them.\n\nHe remembered the words of the letter: \'Break into the second room.\' He was in the first room, and he must now find the second room. He began to hit the wall with his axe. In one place the sound of the axe was a little different. He hit it again. The hard rock broke away easily. Behind it there was a wall of square white stones.\n\n\'Somebody built this opening. Then they painted it to look like rock,\' Dantes thought.\n\nHe felt very weak. He put the axe on the ground and went up the steps, out into the open air.\n\n\'I have not eaten any food for hours. I am not hungry, but I must eat.\' He ate a little bread and took a drink from his water bottle. Then he returned. He was able to use the axe more easily now.\n\n\'This wall in front of me is only made of stones, one on top of another.\' He pulled them off, one by one. Finally, Dantes broke the wall into the second room. It was smaller and darker than the first one. He waited for fresh air to fill the room. Then he went in.\n\nThere was a dark corner to the left of the opening. He looked round this second room. \'If there is treasure,\' he thought, \'it is hidden in that dark corner.\'\n\nDantes went to the corner and began to move the earth. Suddenly, his axe hit a hard place. He lifted the axe to hit the place again. Again he heard the same sound.\n\n\'It is a great wooden chest. There are strong pieces of metal round it,\' he thought, finally. He went outside.\n\nThere, he stood and thought. Then he took a dry piece of wood, lit it, and went down again. He looked at the top of the chest. It was about a metre long and half a metre wide. In the centre, there was a piece of silver in the wood. There was a mark on the silver - the mark of the Spada family.\n\n\'The treasure is here!\' Dantes thought. He tried to lift the box but he couldn\'t. He tried to open it, but there was no key. He took his axe to break it open. The top came away; the wood was old and soft.\n\nThere were three smaller boxes inside. In the first box there were gold coins from many different countries. In the second box were bars of gold. From the third box, Edmond took a handful of gold rings.\n\nHe touched, felt and looked at the treasure. Then Edmond ran quickly back to the steps.

He looked for houses and men on the island, but there were none. It really was an empty place.\n\nHe returned to the treasure place and went into the second room. He took gold and some coins and hid them safely in his clothing. Then he covered the chest with earth, and put sand over the place.\n\n\'Nobody can see anything now,\' he thought. He put a large stone over the opening and covered it with earth. He placed some quick-growing plants in the earth. He went over the ground all around the place, and hid every mark. \'Nobody will find this place.\'\n\nHe waited for his friends to return. That was not easy. He did not want to sit and guard his great treasure. He wanted to return and live with men.\n\n\'These riches will give me great power. Danglars, Caderousse, even Villefort cannot hurt me now. I don\'t need to worry about them. With all this money, I can bring happiness to the people who are nearest to my heart!\'\n\n***\n\nAfter six days, the Young Amelia returned. Dantes went down to the shore. He walked slowly. \'My leg still hurts,\' he said. \'Did your business go well?\'\n\n\'We got the goods safely to land,\' the captain said. \'But when we finished, a government ship from Toulon came after us. We needed you - you are a good sailor and we needed your help. Luckily night came, and we escaped. We have brought the Young Amelia to Monte Cristo to get you.\'\n\nDantes went on board, and the ship sailed for Livorno.\n\nIn Livorno, Dantes sold four of the smallest rings to a shopkeeper. Edmond was afraid. \'Will he ask where I found these rings? I am only a poor seaman.\' But the shopkeeper said nothing.\n\nThe next day, Dantes went to the captain. \'My uncle has died and left me a large amount of money,\' he said. \'I want to leave the ship.\'\n\n\'I am sad to lose you,\' the captain said. \'Can\'t you stay?\'\n\n\'No,\' Dantes said. \'I must leave the Young Amelia.\'\n\nHe gave fine presents to all the men. He gave a new ship and some money to his best friend, Jacopo. After that, he left Livorno and went to Genoa.\n\nIn Genoa he saw a boat builder. The man had a beautiful little ship on the water. \'I built this boat for an Englishman,\' the boat builder said.\n\nIt was very small. \'I can sail it myself, alone, without help\' Dantes thought. \'And it is very fast. No other ship on the water will catch it.\'\n\nDantes offered a lot of money for the boat and asked the builder for the ship\'s papers.\n\n\'The Englishman will not return for some time,\' the boat builder said. \'I am sure that I can build another boat for him.\' So he agreed to sell the boat.\n\nHe offered to find seamen for the ship, but Dantes said, \'I don\'t need anyone. But make me a hidden place on the ship, near the top of my bed.\'\n\nThe builder promised to do the work the next day.\n\n***\n\nDantes sailed away from Genoa alone, and arrived at Monte Cristo on the second day.\n\nHe took his boat to a different place on the shore. There was nobody on the island, and the treasure was still there.\n\nEarly the next day, he began to carry his treasure on board. By evening it was safely hidden in the secret place.\n\nOne fine morning, a small but beautiful boat sailed into Marseilles. Dantes tied it up near some steps. \'I left Marseilles just here, many years ago, to go to the Chateau d\'If,\' he thought.\n\nThe customs officers came on board to look at the ship\'s papers. A soldier stood near the steps. Even now, Dantes was afraid when he saw a soldier.\n\nEdmond now had a different name - a rich man\'s name. He showed the officers the ship\'s papers.\n\n\'This boat is owned by the Count of Monte Cristo,\' the papers said.\n\nThe customs officers wanted to please the rich ship owner. \'The count can go on shore now, if he wants to,\' they said. \'There is no problem with his papers.\'\n\nOld Nicolas, a seaman from the Pharaoh, was one of the first men that he met on shore. Dantes went straight to Nicolas and asked him a number of questions. He watched the man\'s face carefully, but Nicolas did not know him. Dantes gave him some money and turned away. Soon he heard a shout.\n\n\'Stop!\' Nicolas called. Dantes turned back. \'This coin is gold, not silver!\' said the good man. \'It is too much.\'\n\n\'Yes, my good man,\' said Dantes, \'I made a small mistake. Thank you for telling me. Here, take this second gold coin.\'\n\nNicolas was surprised. He could not speak.\n\nDantes continued on his way. Every tree, every street brought back memories of the past. He walked until he saw his father\'s house.\n\nThe door was shut, but from inside he heard the sound of quietly moving feet. Then there was a silence that was broken by a weak cry of pain.\n\nSomeone said very softly, \'Yes, soon. Very soon now. But you must be strong.\'\n\nDantes put out his hand to open the door. But his hand fell back to his side. He could not move.\n\n\'But I tell you - he is here,\' said the weak voice again. \'Go and call him in?\'\n\n\'Try to get a little sleep now. Perhaps when you wake-\'\n\n\'I tell you - he is here. I saw him come up the street. I saw him stand and look up at this window with his clear eyes. He has changed. Tell him to come quickly. Tell him that Death is waiting at my side.\' The voice grew stronger. \'Open the door, I say, and bring him in!\'\n\nThere were footsteps. The door opened slowly - and Mercedes stood there.\n\nShe saw him. At first, she did not know him. Then she fell forward with a cry.\n\n\'It is you!\' she cried. Then, taking his hand, she pulled him into the room. \'Come quickly. He wants to see you.\'\n\nThe old eyes looked up at him, dark and beautiful with a last silent look of love. Then the eyes closed.\n\n\'Kiss me,\' he said. \'Hold me in your arms, Edmond. Death, you can come and take me now!\'\n\n***\n\nNapoleon returned to France in 1815. Danglars left the country, and nobody saw him again.\n\n\'Caderousse is still alive,\' said Mercedes, \'but he is very poor.\'\n\n***\n\n\'Look,\' said old Nicolas to a soldier standing by the steps. Far away on the Mediterranean Sea, there was a white sail.\n\n\'He has gone,\' said old Nicolas, \'that rich Count.\'\n\n\'Yes.

(12530, 'Three men in a boat by Jerome K. Jerome\n\nPart 1\n\nHealth Problems\n\nThere were four of us - George, William Samuel Harris, myself (my friends call me J), and Montmorency. We were sitting in my room and were smoking and talking about our bad health.\n\nWe were all feeling very ill, and we were unhappy about it. Harris said he felt dizzy sometimes. George felt dizzy, too.\n\nMy big problem was my liver. I knew I had a bad liver. I had read about all the symptoms of liver disease in a book. I had every symptom that was written.\n\nEvery time I read about an illness, I realise that I have it.\n\nOne day, I had a little health problem. I went to the British Museum Library to read about it. After some time, I began reading about another illness. I don\'t remember the name now, but it was something terrible. I knew I had that terrible illness, too.\n\nI began reading the book from the letter \'a\' to the letter \'z\' I had the symptoms of all the diseases in the book, except for one!\n\nI didn\'t have housemaid\'s knee. This made me a bit unhappy. Why didn\'t I have housemaid\'s knee, too?\n\nWith all the diseases I had, I knew my life was short. I tried to examine myself. I tried to feel my heart. I tried to look at my tongue. When I had walked into the library, I had been a happy, healthy man. When I left it, I was a very ill man.\n\nI went to see my doctor. He is an old friend. Whenever I think I am ill, he examines me and says I am fine. A doctor really must have practice! This time, I thought, he will get more practice with me than with a thousand normal patients. After all, normal patients have only one or two diseases each.\n\n\'Well, what\'s wrong with you?\' he asked.\n\nI said, \'If I tell you what is wrong with me, you will die before I finish. Life is too short! I\'ll tell you what is not wrong with me... I don\'t have housemaid\'s knee. But I have everything else.\'\n\nI told him about what I had read at the library.\n\nHe looked at me carefully. He listened to my heart and looked at my tongue. After that, he wrote a prescription I and gave it to me. I put it in my pocket and went out.\n\nI didn\'t read the prescription. I took it to the chemist\'s and gave it to him. He read it and gave it back to me. He said, \'I don\'t have the things on the prescription.\'\n\n\'But you\'re a chemist, aren\'t you?\' I asked.\n\nHe said, \'You\'re right, sir. I\'m a chemist. I don\'t have a shop and a hotel.\'\n\nI read the prescription. It said:\n\nEvery six hours: lb of good, fresh meat, pint of beer\n\nEvery morning: ten-mile walk\n\nGo to bed no later than II o\'clock each night and don\'t read books about things you don\'t understand.\n\nI followed the doctor\'s prescription. It saved my life. I now feel rather well, except for my liver problem. The main symptom of liver disease is \'a general feeling of sleepiness and no interest in working.\'\n\nI have suffered from this illness ever since I was a boy. Medical science was not advanced in those days. Doctors did not know that I had liver illness. They thought I was lazy. People called me \'a lazy little devil\', and said, \'go and do your work.\' They did not know I was ill with liver disease. Instead of giving me liver pills, they gave me blows on the head. Those blows were good for me, because after each blow I went to do my work. That old remedy worked better than a box of modern pills.\n\nThat evening, George, William Harris and I sat in my room. We described our illnesses. I explained to George and William Harris how I felt in the morning. William Harris told us how he felt when he went to bed. Then George stood up, and told us how he felt at night.\n\nGeorge always thinks he is ill, but there is really nothing wrong with him.\n\nAt that moment, Mrs Poppets, the housekeeper, I served our dinner. We were not hungry. We ate some meat, onions and cake. We had no interest in food.\n\nWe began talking about our illnesses again. We all knew that our illnesses were caused by too much work.\n\n\'We need a rest,\' said Harris.\n\n\'A rest and a change,\' George added. \'Our minds are tired from too much work. We must rest our minds.\'\n\n\'Let\'s go to the countryside!\' I said. \'We\'ll find a nice, quiet place, with no people.\'\n\nHarris said, \'Oh, how boring! In the country everyone goes to bed at eight o\'clock. You can\'t even find a newspaper! If you want a rest and a change, then the best place is the sea.\'\n\n\'What a terrible idea!\' I said. \'A sea trip gives you seasickness. Who wants a whole week of seasickness? You leave on Monday and you\'re feeling well. On Tuesday you feel worse. Then on Wednesday you\'re really sick. On Thursday and Friday you\'re almost dead. On Saturday you can finally drink a few teaspoons of tea. On Sunday you can walk again and eat some food. Then on Monday you\'re happy, because it\'s time to get off the boat.\'\n\nSo George said, \'Let\'s go up the river. We\'ll have fresh air and quiet on the river. The hard work on the boat will make us hungry, so we\'ll enjoy our food. We\'ll be so tired at the end of the day, that we\'ll sleep well.\'\n\nHarris said, \'You don\'t have any trouble sleeping, George. There are only twenty-four hours in the day, and you sleep most of that time. If you sleep any more, you\'re dead! However, I like your idea of a holiday on the River Thames.\'\n\nI liked it too. George was surprised that we both liked his idea. The only one who didn\'t like the idea was Montmorency, my fox-terrier. He looked at us with his big eyes.\n\n\'You like the idea, but I don\'t,\' his face said. \'On the river there\'s nothing for me to do. I don\'t like looking at the trees. I certainly don\'t smoke. If I see a rat, you won\'t stop the boat so I can run after it. When I\'m asleep, you\'ll probably rock the boat, and I\'ll fall into the river. The whole idea is stupid.\'\n\nWe were three to one. So we decided to go on the river trip.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12529, 11701),
(12532, 'Three men in a boat by Jerome K. Jerome\n\nPart 2\n\nPlanning the Trip\n\nWe looked at the maps and we discussed plans. We decided to start from Kingston the following Saturday.\n\n\'Harris, you and I will go to get the boat at Kingston,\' I said. \'Then we\'ll take it up the river to Chertsey, where we\'ll meet George.\'\n\nGeorge works in the City until the afternoon. (George goes to sleep at a bank from ten o\'clock to four o\'clock, Monday to Friday, except on Saturdays. On Saturdays, they wake him up at two o\'clock, and put him outside the door.)\n\nThe next problem was where to sleep at night. George and I didn\'t want to sleep at inns. We wanted to camp out in the middle of nature.\n\n\'How beautiful,\' we said, \'sleeping in the country, under the stars, by the river!\'\n\n\'I can imagine it all!\' I said. There is a golden sunset. The river is moving along quietly. The forest is full of trees and birds. The grass around us is green, and little flowers grow here and there.\n\n\'Soon it is dark. We row our boat into a quiet corner on the river. We put up our tent and cook a simple, healthy meal. We all sit around a warm fire and eat our meal.\n\n\'We look up and see the moon and the stars. Then we sit in silence. How wonderful this is! We go to bed, and then we dream under the stars! We dream that the world is young again.\'\n\nAs we all sat there dreaming, Harris said, \'What happens if it rains?\'\n\nThere is nothing poetic about Harris. He is not romantic at all. If Harris ever has tears in his eyes, he is eating raw onions. If you stand by the sea with Harris and say, \'Listen to the sounds of the sea. Can you hear spirits singing sad songs - the songs of those who died in these waters?\' he will take you by the arm and say, \'I understand, my friend. You\'re not feeling well. Now, come with me. I know a place around the corner here, where you can get some good whisky. You\'ll feel better soon.\' Harris always knows where you can find a good whisky.\n\nHarris was right about camping out when it rains. It\'s not nice at all. Just imagine: it is evening. You are all wet. There is water in the boat and all your things are wet. You find a place on the river bank. You get out of the boat and pull out the tent. Now two of you try to put it up.\n\nThe tent is wet and very heavy. It is raining hard. The wind is blowing. The wet tent flies about. It falls on your head and makes you angry. It is difficult to put up a tent in good weather. It is impossible to do so in wet weather. The other man is of no help at all. He is a complete fool!\n\nThe wind continues to blow and the rain continues to fall. You look at the other man and say, \'What are you doing with your side of the tent?\'\n\n\'What are you doing?\' he answers.\n\n\'Don\'t pull on your side!\' you shout.\n\n\'I didn\'t pull. You pulled!\' he shouts.\n\n\'You\'re doing everything wrong!\' you shout.\n\n\'What?\' he shouts, \'I can\'t hear you.\'\n\n\'You don\'t know how to put up a tent! We\'ll never put up this tent,\' you say.\n\nAt this point, the third man has pulled the boat out of the water. He is completely wet. He wants to know why the tent isn\'t up yet. Everyone is wet and angry.\n\nHarris was right. Camping out in rainy weather is not a good idea. We decided to camp out in good weather and sleep at an inn or a hotel in bad weather. Montmorency agreed with this decision. He likes inns and hotels.\n\nMontmorency doesn\'t like the quiet life. He prefers noise and confusion. He looks like a good, well-behaved dog. But he\'s not. When you look at Montmorency, you see an angel from paradise, in the form of a small fox-terrier. You think he is a sweet, gentle little dog. When old ladies and gentlemen look at him, tears come to their eyes.\n\nWhen he killed twelve chickens, and I paid for them, I changed my opinion of Montmorency. In one year, he had one hundred and fourteen street fights with other dogs. An angry woman brought me her dead cat and called me a murderer. Montmorency loves to join the worst dogs. He then takes them around town to fight other dogs. This is his idea of a happy life.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12531, 11701),
(12534, 'Three men in a boat by Jerome K. Jerome\n\nPart 3\n\nPacking\n\nThe following evening we met again to discuss our plans. Harris said, \'Now, we must decide what to take with us. You get a piece of paper, J, and you get a pencil, George. I\'ll write the list.\'\n\nHarris is always like this. He tells everyone what to do, and he does nothing.\n\nMy old Uncle Podger was just like Harris. When Uncle Podger did a job, everybody in the house helped. One day, Uncle Podger bought a picture. Aunt Podger asked, \'Where can we put this picture?\'\n\n\'Leave it to me. Don\'t worry about it. I\'ll do it all,\' Uncle Podger said.\n\nHe sent one of the girls to buy the nails. Then he sent one of the boys to tell her the size of the nails. He sent Bill to get the hammer, and he sent Tom to get the ruler.\n\n\'Now get me a kitchen chair, Jim. I need two people to hold the chair. Maria, come here and hold the light. Tom, come here and give me the nail.\'\n\nHe finally had the nail in his hand, but it fell on the floor.\n\nEveryone looked everywhere for the nail. When someone finally found it, Uncle Podger lost the hammer.\n\n\'Where\'s the hammer? Where did I put the hammer? Help me find the hammer!\'\n\nWhen we found the hammer, he lost the place on the wall to put the picture. So each one of us climbed up on the chair to look for the place. Each one thought it was a different place. When Uncle Podger climbed up on the chair, he fell on the piano. Aunt Podger was very angry. She said, \'The next time you put a picture on the wall, please tell me. I\'ll go and spend a week with my mother!\'\n\nUncle Podger tried again and again. At midnight, the picture was on the wall. However, it was not straight. The wall was dirty. Everyone was tired and unhappy. Uncle Podger looked at the picture and said, \'It was such an easy job!\'\n\nI told Harris, \'You get the paper and pencil. George will write the list, and I\'ll do the work.\'\n\nThe first list was too long. We threw it away. We started another list.\n\n\'In order to travel to the north part of the River Thames, we need a small boat,\' George said. \'With a small boat, we can carry only necessary things. We won\'t take a heavy tent. We can put a canvas cover I over the boat at night. It will be like a little house, warm and comfortable.\'\n\nWe made a list of all the clothes we needed. George said he knew everything about the right clothes for a trip. We discovered later that this wasn\'t true.\n\nWe talked about food next. George said, \'Let\'s continue with breakfast. For breakfast we\'ll need a frying pan.\'\n\n\'That\'s quite difficult to eat,\' Harris said, smiling.\n\n\'Stop being stupid, Harris,\' I said.\n\n\'Let\'s continue,\' said George. \'We\'ll need tea, sugar, eggs, bacon, bread, butter and jam. For lunch, we can take biscuits, cold meat, and fruit - but no cheese. The smell of cheese is too strong. After a day or two, everything will smell of cheese.\n\n\'For dinner, we can take meat pies, fruit pies, tomatoes and green vegetables. This good food will keep us healthy,\' George said.\n\nWe didn\'t take wine or beer, because they both make you sleep.\n\nGeorge continued, \'We\'ll also need a teapot, a pan and a camping stove. We don\'t want a paraffin oil stove.\'\n\n\'Oh, no, not a paraffin oil stove!\' I said. We once took a paraffin oil stove. It was horrible. The smell of paraffin oil was everywhere. The river smelled of paraffin. The wind smelled of paraffin. Even the sunset smelled of paraffin. When we visited the town of Marlow, it smelled of paraffin, too! Even the church of Marlow smelled of paraffin. The countryside for miles around smelled of paraffin. We decided never to take a paraffin oil stove again.\n\nThe next day we bought everything we needed. We met in the evening to pack our suitcases. We got a large suitcase for the clothes, and two large hampers for the food and utensils.\n\nI am very good at packing. Packing is one of those things that I do best.\n\n\'I\'ll organise the packing,\' I said to George and Harris. They agreed. George sat in the armchair and Harris put his feet up on the table.\n\nThis was not what I had intended. I wanted to organise the packing - not do it! I wanted George and Harris to do all the work. However, I didn\'t say anything. I started packing the clothes. It took a long time, but I finally finished. I sat on the big suitcase to close it. George and Harris watched me.\n\n\'Aren\'t you putting the boots in?\' asked Harris.\n\nI had forgotten them!\n\n\'Why didn\'t you tell me before?\' I said. Harris said nothing. George laughed. I was furious. I opened the suitcase again, and packed the boots. Then an awful idea came to me. Did I pack my toothbrush?\n\nI started looking for it. I took everything out of the suitcase. I found George\'s toothbrush. I found Harris\'s toothbrush. But I didn\'t find mine. In the end, I found it inside a boot. I packed everything again.\n\nWhen I finished, George asked me, \'Is the soap in the suitcase?\'\n\n\'I don\'t care about the soap,\' I answered. I sat on the big suitcase again to close it. Then I remembered that my cigarettes were in the suitcase. I opened it again and finally closed it at 10:50 p.m.\n\nThere were still the two hampers to pack. Harris and George decided to pack them.

And, this was just the beginning! George is the worst packer in the world. When George dies, Harris will be the worst packer in the world.\n\nThey walked on things and broke them. Harris put a big jar of jam on top of a tomato and crushed it. George stepped on a big packet of butter, and Harris sat on it. Soon there was butter everywhere. They packed the pies in the hamper. Then they put heavy things on top of them. The pies were crushed, just like the tomato.\n\nIn the middle of all of this, there was Montmorency, of course. He put his leg in the sugar, and soon there was sugar everywhere. He ran away with the teaspoons. He pretended that the lemons were rats, and killed three of them! This was Montmorency\'s idea of fun.\n\nAt one in the morning, the packing was finished. We were ready for bed.\n\nGeorge said, \'What time shall I wake you up?\'\n\nHarris said, \'Seven o\'clock.\'\n\nI said, \'Six o\'clock.\'\n\n\'Wake us up at half past six, George,\' we said.\n\nIt was Mrs Poppets, who woke me up the next morning. \'Do you know that it\'s nearly nine o\'clock?\'\n\n\'What!\' I shouted, as I jumped out of bed. I woke up Harris and George. We began to get ready, and we remembered that we had packed our toothbrushes. So we went to get them out of the suitcase. This was not an easy job.\n\nAt last, we were ready to eat breakfast. While we ate breakfast, George read the newspaper. He told us about the people killed on the river, and about the bad weather report.\n\nGeorge went to work, and Harris and I finished our breakfast. That morning, Montmorency invited two of his friends to the house. They fought most of the time.\n\nWhen we were finally ready, we carried our luggage to the road. We waited twenty minutes for a taxi. Taxis usually come every three minutes.\n\nA crowd of people was watching us. They looked at us, at Montmorency, and at Montmorency\'s friends. They looked at all our luggage: a big suitcase, a small bag, two big hampers, some pans, some umbrellas, five coats and raincoats.\n\nAt Waterloo Station, we took the 11:05 train to Kingston. At\n\nKingston, our boat was waiting for us below the bridge. Harris and I put our luggage in it. We got on the boat happily, but Montmorency was worried. Harris took the oars and we started our two-week trip on the River Thames.\n\nHarris was wearing a red and orange blazer. It was a beautiful, sunny day. We were enjoying the first moments of our holiday.\n\nWhen we passed Hampton Court Palace, Harris asked, \'Have you ever visited the maze here?\' He said he had gone into the maze once to show a friend. He studied a map of the maze before going in. He knew it was very easy to get out again.\n\nHarris said to his friend, \'We\'ll go in and walk around for ten minutes. Then we\'ll come out and have lunch. It\'s very easy. Take the first turn to the right each time.\'\n\nIn the maze, they met some people who had been there for forty-five minutes. They wanted to get out because they were lost. Harris said, \'Follow me! I\'m going out in ten minutes.\' The people thanked him and started following him. Other people began following Harris, too. Some of them were worried and afraid. He continued turning to the right, but he was still in the maze.\n\nHarris got lost! The people were angry with him. They all started calling for help. A young keeper heard them and came to help. But, he got lost, too! Finally, the old keeper came back from lunch. He let the people out. Everyone was tired and angry.\n\nHarris said, \'Let\'s ask George to try the maze, on our return trip.\'\n\n\'Not a bad idea,\' I said.\n\nWhen we passed Molesey Lock, we were the only boat in the big lock. Usually, the lock is a very busy place. On Sundays, there are boats everywhere. People like the river and the sun. It\'s such a beautiful picture - the river, the trees, the flowers and the people, in their colourful clothes.\n\nAt Hampton, Harris wanted to stop the boat and have a look at the church. I don\'t like visiting churches, but Harris loves it.\n\n\'I came on the trip only because I wanted to visit Hampton Church. You know, I love churches, churchyards and tombs. The idea of not seeing Hampton Church, with Mrs Thomas\'s tomb, makes me angry.\'\n\n\'Who is Mrs Thomas?\' I asked.\n\n\'I don\'t know, but she has a strange tomb.\'\n\nI said, \'We must be at Shepperton at five o\'clock to meet George.\'\n\nHarris said, \'George! Why can\'t George be here to do some work? Why doesn\'t he help us with this heavy boat? What does he do at the bank? He sits behind a piece of glass all day and does nothing. I work! Why doesn\'t he work? I\'m going to have a drink!\'\n\n\'There are no pubs near here. The nearest pub is far away,\' I said.\n\n\'What! We\'ll all die of thirst. No pubs!\'\n\n\'If you\'re thirsty, we have water in the boat.\' I said.\n\n\'Water!

QE Good food always calms Harris.\n\nWe reached Sunbury Lock at half past three. We then went to Walton, which is a historical town. Julius Caesar stayed there with his soldiers. Queen Elizabeth I stayed there, too. You can never escape from that woman. She was everywhere!\n\nNext we came to Halliford and Shepperton. There is a tomb in the Shepperton churchyard with a poem on it. I was afraid Harris wanted to stop and visit it. I saw him looking at the church, as we passed near it, so I moved the boat suddenly, and Harris\'s cap fell into the water. He pulled it out and was angry with me. Fortunately, he was worried about his wet cap and forgot about the church.\n\nAs we came to Weybridge, the first thing we saw was a coloured blazer. When we got closer, we saw that George was inside the blazer. Montmorency started barking furiously.\n\nHarris and I shouted loudly. George waved his cap and shouted, too. The lock-keeper I ran out, because he thought someone had fallen into the water. When he saw that no one was in the water, he returned to his work.\n\nNow that George was on the boat, we decided to make him work. He did not want to work, of course.\n\n\'I had a bad day at the bank,\' George said.\n\nHarris, who is a little cruel, said, \'Now you\'re going to have a bad day on the river. A change is good for you. It\'s healthy! Come on! Get out of the boat and TOW!\'\n\nGeorge didn\'t know what to say. After a moment, he said, \'It\'s better if I stay here and prepare tea. It\'s very difficult to prepare tea, and you look tired.\'\n\nWe didn\'t answer. We gave him the rope. He started walking and pulling the boat.\n\nI remember that George once saw a young couple who were walking by the side of the river. They were pulling a rope behind them, and they were talking. They didn\'t notice that there was no boat at the end of the rope. They had probably had a boat at the end of the rope when they started. But they had lost it.\n\nWhen George saw this, he took the rope out of the water. Then he tied it to his own boat. So, the young couple towed George and his three fat friends up to Marlow. When they looked back, they saw that they were towing a boat that was not theirs. The young man was surprised and angry. The young lady said, \'Oh, Henry, where is Aunt Mary?\'\n\nNo one knew what happened to Aunt Mary.\n\nThe most exciting thing is to let girls tow your boat. You always need three girls. Two of them hold the rope. The third one runs around and laughs all the time.\n\nWhen they are finally ready to pull, they start running. They pull the boat too fast, and they are soon tired. They sit down on the grass to rest and laugh. While they rest, your boat goes out into the middle of the river. \'Oh, look,\' they say, \'the boat\'s gone to the middle of the river!\'\n\nThey laugh, jump up and start pulling it again. Then one of them decides to stop, because she needs her hat. Then another wants her red shawl. I Now one of them needs a comb for her hair. The other wants her handkerchief. This goes on for most of the afternoon. It is never boring when three girls tow a boat.\n\nGeorge towed us to Penton Hook. We stopped there and decided to spend the night on the boat. We found a pretty place. We tied our boat to a big tree.\n\nWe were all hungry and we wanted to eat. However, George said, \'No, let\'s put the canvas cover on the boat first. It will only take a few minutes.\'\n\nIt looked simple, but it wasn\'t. There were five metal rods. You put them into special holes in the side of the boat. I didn\'t think this was dangerous work, but it was. I\'m surprised that we are still alive to tell the story.\n\nFirst of all, the metal rods did not go into their holes. We jumped on them, kicked them and pushed them. When the rods were in their holes, we tried to put the canvas cover on the boat.\n\nGeorge took one part of the cover. He tied it at the front of the boat. Harris stood in the middle to help George with the cover. George did his job well, but Harris was completely confused.\n\nAfter ten minutes of hard work, Harris was inside the cover! He was fighting to get out. He accidentally knocked George down. Now George was inside the cover, too. They fought with the cover. I heard some very bad words. I thought the job must be very difficult.\n\nI didn\'t understand what was happening. George and Harris had told Montmorency and me to stand at the back of the boat. We did exactly that. We waited quietly. We saw the cover moving violently, but we thought this was the correct method.\n\nAfter a long time, we heard George shout, \'We can\'t breathe under here! Why don\'t you help us, you idiot!\'\n\nWhen someone calls for help, I always answer. I went to help them. Poor Harris, his face was almost black.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12537, 11701),
(12540, 'Three men in a boat by Jerome K. Jerome\n\nPart 6\n\nHarris Makes Scrambled Eggs\n\nAs soon as the cover was in place, we started to prepare supper. We wanted some hot water to make tea. We put the tea kettle on the stove. We pretended that we were not interested in the water. We wanted the water to think that we did not care about it. We began to prepare supper.\n\nThis was the only way to make the water boil on a boat. If the water knows you are waiting for it, it will never get hot. You must not look at it. It\'s a good idea to shout, \'I don\'t want any tea. Do you, George?\'\n\nGeorge shouts back, \'Oh, no. I don\'t like tea. I\'ll have milk.\'\n\n\'And you, Harris?\'\n\n\'Tea is terrible. I never drink it. I\'ll have lemonade.\'\n\nThis makes the water very angry. At this point, the water will boil!\n\nWe really wanted that supper. We needed that supper. For thirty-five minutes nobody spoke. We just ate and ate. Finally, we all had full stomachs, and we were happy. A full stomach makes you feel kind and generous. We sat and smiled at each other. We smiled at Montmorency, too. We started smoking our pipes and began to talk.\n\nWe went to bed at ten o\'clock. I didn\'t sleep well. I wasn\'t comfortable in the boat. I woke up at six o\'clock the next morning, and George did, too. There was no reason to wake up so early. We were on holiday. Why did we wake up so early? It never happens to us when we\'re working.\n\nWe decided to wake up Harris. This was hard work. We used an oar to help us. Harris moved a bit and said, \'I\'ll be downstairs in a minute. Get my best boots ready, please.\'\n\nWe tried again with a boat hook. Harris sat up suddenly and Montmorency fell off the bed. We pulled up the canvas cover and all four of us looked out at the river. We were very cold. We had planned to go swimming, but the water looked so cold and wet.\n\n\'Well, who\'s going swimming first?\' asked Harris.\n\nNo one wanted to be first. George decided to get dressed. Montmorency barked with horror at the idea. Harris went to look for his trousers.\n\nI decided to go to the river bank and throw some water on myself.\n\nI held on to the branch of a tree as I moved to the water. It was very cold and I decided not to go in. I wanted to go back to the boat. But suddenly, the branch of the tree broke! I fell into the river along with my towel. I also drank about a bottle of Thames water.\n\n\'Good heavens! Old J is in the water!\' Harris said.\n\n\'How\'s the water?\' George asked.\n\n\'It\'s lovely!\' I answered. \'Why don\'t you come in?\'\n\nNobody wanted to try the water. When I got back to the boat, I was very cold. I wanted to put on my shirt, but it fell into the river. This made me angry. George started laughing.\n\n\'I don\'t see anything to laugh at,\' I said.\n\nGeorge laughed even more. I never saw a man laugh so much. I was cold and furious. I was trying to get my shirt out of the river. George was laughing louder and louder.\n\n\'Stop laughing, you stupid idiot!\' I shouted.\n\nWhen I finally pulled the shirt out of the river, I saw that it wasn\'t mine - it was George\'s shirt! I started laughing too. I laughed so much that I dropped the shirt into the river again.\n\n\'Aren\'t you going to get it out?\' said George, who continued laughing.\n\nI didn\'t answer him for a while, because I was laughing so much. At last I said, \'it isn\'t my shirt. It\'s yours!\'\n\nI never saw a man\'s face change so quickly.\n\n\'What!\' he shouted. \'You donkey! I Why can\'t you be careful with things? Why don\'t you go and get dressed on the river bank? People like you don\'t know how to live on a boat!\'\n\nI tried to tell him how funny it was, but he didn\'t understand. George is a little slow at understanding a joke sometimes.\n\nHarris said, \'I\'m cooking scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning. Once people try my scrambled eggs, they always want them.\'\n\nHe was quite famous for his scrambled eggs. George and I got the stove and the frying pan ready. Then we looked for the eggs that weren\'t broken. We found only six of them.\n\n\'Now you can start,\' we said.\n\nBreaking the eggs was difficult for Harris. The eggs got on his trousers and went up his arms. He put six eggs into the frying pan. Then he sat down by the stove and mixed them with a fork.\n\nGeorge and I saw that it was difficult work. Harris often burnt his fingers. Then he danced around the stove. He waved his hands in the air and shouted. George and I thought that this was an important part of his cooking method.\n\nWe didn\'t know what scrambled eggs were. We thought they were some sort of Red Indian food, and, to cook them correctly, it was necessary to do special dances with magic words.\n\nMontmorency went to put his nose over the frying pan once, and burnt himself. He, too, began dancing around and barking. It was interesting and exciting to watch this show. George and I were sorry when it was finished.\n\nWhen the scrambled eggs were ready, there was very little to eat. Six eggs had gone into the pan. But, all that came out was a teaspoon full of burnt eggs.\n\n\'The problem is the frying pan,\' Harris said. \'I need another type of pan and another stove.\'\n\nWe decided not to try scrambled eggs again, until Harris had the right pan and stove.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12539, 11701),
(12542, 'Three men in a boat by Jerome K. Jerome\n\nPart 7\n\nThe Laughing Tin\n\nWhen we finished breakfast, the sun was up and it was a warm morning. I sat on the river bank near Runnymede. I thought about King John, who signed the Magna Carta at Runnymede, in II5. What a great moment in English history! I imagined the scene!\n\nGeorge came over and said, \'When you finish resting and dreaming, please help me wash the dishes and other things.\'\n\nI cleaned the frying pan with some grass and with George\'s wet shirt.\n\nLater on, we went to Magna Carta Island. We saw the stone where the Magna Carta was signed. In this area, King Henry VIII met with his sweetheart, I Anne Boleyn. I am certain that King Henry VIII met Anne Boleyn in several other places, too.\n\nWe continued slowly up the river, and stopped for lunch near Monkey Island. We had cold meat for lunch.\n\n\'Where\'s the mustard?\' I asked.\n\n\'The mustard?\' Harris said.\n\nWe had forgotten to bring the mustard. At that moment, we all wanted mustard more than anything in the world.\n\n\'How boring life is without mustard!\' said George.\n\nWe ate our cold meat in silence. We thought about the happy days of childhood when there was lots of mustard on the table. The adult world can be a cruel place.\n\nAll three of us loved tinned fruit. George brought out a tin of pineapple. This was perfect to make us forget the mustard. We felt that life was smiling at us again.\n\n\'Look at the picture on the tin!\' said Harris.\n\n\'Ah, I can\'t wait!\' I said.\n\n\'I\'m dreaming about the sweet juice,\' George said.\n\nHarris got a spoon ready.\n\nThen we looked for the tin-opener. We took everything out of the two hampers. We took everything out of the bag. We looked in every corner of the boat. There was no tin-opener.\n\nHarris tried to open the tin with a little knife, and he cut himself. George tried to open it with a pair of scissors. The scissors flew up and almost cut his eye. I tried to open it with a piece of metal. I did something wrong, because I fell into the river. The tin flew away and broke a teacup.\n\nThen we all got angry. I started hitting the tin with a piece of wood. Harris hit the tin, and so did George. We changed its shape. We made it square. We made it round. Then we made it flat. But, we still couldn\'t open it.\n\nThe tin looked at us and seemed to be laughing. It was ugly and it frightened us. I threw it in the river! Then we rowed away and didn\'t stop until we reached Maidenhead.\n\nIt was evening and a strong wind started blowing. The wind was behind us and we put up the sail quickly. The wind blew and the boat flew up the river.\n\nI was steering I the boat, and George and Harris were enjoying the trip. Sailing is exciting. It\'s almost like flying. You feel that you are part of nature. We were alone and we flew along the river. Far in the distance, we saw a small fishing boat. There were three fishermen in it.\n\nThe sun was going down, and there was a red light on the water. The river seemed magic. It was like a dream. We felt that we were sailing into a strange land.\n\nWe did not sail into a strange land. We sailed straight into the fishing boat with the three old fishermen! At first, we didn\'t know what was happening. But, when we heard the bad words that came from the other boat, we knew we were near people. We also knew that those people were not happy.\n\nThe three old fishermen fell off their seats. There were fish all over them. They slowly tried to get up. As they did this, they cursed us. They didn\'t curse us with common curses. They used long, special curses. They also cursed our parents, families, friends, neighbours, pets and jobs. These curses were for the present and the future.\n\nHarris stood up and said, \'Be thankful for a bit of excitement in your lives! Your lives must be so boring, just sitting and fishing all day. My friends and I are very unhappy to hear men of your age use such bad words.\' The three old men did not agree with Harris.\n\n\'I\'ll steer the boat now, J,\' said George. \'An intelligent man like you must do better things. Leave the steering to me, before we all drown.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12541, 11701),
(12544, 'Three men in a boat by Jerome K. Jerome\n\nPart 8\n\nMontmorency Meets a Cat\n\nAt Marlow, we left our boat by the bridge. We spent the night at the Crown Hotel. The next morning we went swimming before breakfast.\n\nOn the way back, Montmorency met a cat. Montmorency and I don\'t agree on cats. I like cats. Montmorency doesn\'t. When I meet a cat, I stop and say hello. I petI it gently. The cat is happy, and I am too. When Montmorency meets a cat, the whole street knows about it. A lot of bad words fly through the air.\n\nAs soon as Montmorency saw the cat, he barked with happiness. The cat was walking slowly across the street. Montmorency ran after the cat. But the cat didn\'t run. He didn\'t understand that his life was in danger.\n\nThis cat was big and black. It had half a tail, half a nose and only one ear. It was a clever street cat.\n\nMontmorency is a courageous dog, but the cold eyes of that cat terrified him. The cat stopped in the middle of the road and looked at Montmorency.\n\nNeither spoke, but the conversation was probably like this:\n\nCat: Yes! You want me? Can I do anything for you?\n\nMontmorency: No, no thanks.\n\nCat: If you really want something, please tell me.\n\nMontmorency: (walking backwards) Oh, no, not at all. Don\'t disturb yourself. I\'m afraid I made a mistake. I thought I knew you. Sorry I disturbed you.\n\nCat: Not at all. It\'s a pleasure. Are you sure you don\'t want anything now?\n\nMontmorency: (still walking backwards) No, thanks. Nothing at all, thanks. Very kind of you. Good morning.\n\nCat: Good morning.\n\nThe cat got up and walked away. Montmorency came back and followed us quietly. He was silent all day long.\n\nTo this day, if you say the word \'Cats!\' to Montmorency, he\'ll stop walking. Then he\'ll look up at you, as if to say: \'Please don\'t!\'\n\nAfter this, we did our shopping, returned to the boat and continued our trip up the river.\n\nAt Hambledon Lock, we discovered that we had no water. We went to the lock-keeper to ask for some. George spoke for us. With a friendly smile he asked, \'May we have some water, please.\'\n\n\'Certainly,\' said the old lock-keeper. \'Take as much as you want, and leave the rest.\'\n\n\'Thank you very much,\' said George, looking around. \'Where is the water?\'\n\n\'It\'s where it always is,\' said the lock-keeper. \'It\'s behind you.\'\n\nGeorge turned around and looked. \'I don\'t see it.\'\n\n\'What! Where are your eyes?\' the lock-keeper said. He took George\'s arm and turned him around.\n\n\'Oh!\' George said. \'But we can\'t drink the river!\'\n\n\'No, but you can drink some of it,\' said the lock-keeper. \'I\'ve drunk river water for the past fifteen years.\'\n\n\'Well, sir, I don\'t think you look very healthy, after drinking all that river water. But thank you anyway,\' George said.\n\nWe left the lock-keeper\'s place and we found some water at another house.\n\nWe towed the boat past Henley and stopped near Wargrave for lunch. We were sitting in a green field near the river. Harris was cutting a meat pie. George and I were waiting with our dishes.\n\n\'I need a spoon,\' said Harris.\n\nThe hamper was behind us. George and I both turned around to get a spoon. In five seconds, we had the spoon. When we turned back, Harris and the meat pie were gone! Disappeared!\n\nIt was a wide open field. There were no trees nearby. Harris did not fall into the river, because the river was far from us. George and I looked all around. Then we looked at each other.\n\n\'Has he gone up to heaven?\' I asked.\n\n\'Angels don\'t take meat pies to heaven,\' George said.\n\n\'You\'re right!\' I agreed.\n\n\'Then there has been an earthquake,\' George said. \'I\'m sorry he had the meat pie with him.\'\n\nSadly, we looked at the place where Harris and the meat pie were sitting. Then, with horror, we saw Harris\'s head - only his head. It was in the grass! His face was red and furious.\n\nGeorge was the first to speak. \'Say something! Are you dead or alive? Where is your body?\'\n\n\'Oh, don\'t be an idiot!\' Harris shouted. \'I think you made this happen. You told me to sit there. It\'s your stupid joke! Here, take the pie.\'\n\nHarris didn\'t know it, but he had been sitting next to a big hole. The long grass covered it. He fell into the deep hole without knowing anything. At first, he thought that it was the end of the world.\n\nHarris still thinks that George and I planned it all.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12543, 11701),
(12546, 'Three men in a boat by Jerome K. Jerome\n\nPart 9\n\nFighting Swans\n\nAfter lunch, a gentle wind pushed us up the river past Wargrave and Shiplake. We got out of the boat at Sonning and walked around the village. Sonning is a lovely village. Everything is clean and beautiful. Each house is covered with roses. We decided to return to one of the Shiplake islands to spend the night.\n\nGeorge said, \'Let\'s have a special supper tonight. Let\'s make an Irish stew. We can put everything into one big pan.\'\n\n\'What a wonderful idea!\' Harris and I said.\n\n\'I\'ll get the wood and make a fire,\' George said. \'You two can peel the potatoes.\'\n\nThis was a very big job. We were happy and excited. But when we peeled our first potato, we understood that this was not exciting - it was hard work. The first potato we peeled looked like a pea.\n\nGeorge looked at it and said, \'No, no, no! There\'s no potato left. Do it like this.\'\n\nWe worked hard for half an hour, but we peeled only four potatoes. We refused to continue.\n\n\'Well, just put the potatoes in without peeling them. Let\'s add some carrots and other vegetables. Look in the hampers and take out all the pieces of old food. We\'ll put them in the stew. You can put anything in a stew.\'\n\nWe found half a pork pie, a tin of fish and a few broken eggs. We added these to the stew. Montmorency watched us carefully and then left. After a while, he returned with a dead rat in his mouth. He wanted to add something to the stew, too. We discussed it first.\n\nHarris said, \'It\'s all right to add the dead rat. It will be mixed with the other things. A stew needs many ingredients.\'\n\nGeorge said, \'Well, I don\'t want to try anything new. Maybe next time. I\'m sorry, Montmorency.\'\n\nHarris said, \'If you never try anything new, you\'ll never discover things. It\'s men like you, George, who slow down the progress of our world.\'\n\nGeorge didn\'t listen to Harris.\n\nThe stew was a great success. It was delicious - excellent in every way. We all really enjoyed it.\n\nAfter the Irish stew, George and I decided to go to Henley for an evening walk. Harris wanted to stay on the boat and drink a whisky.\n\nWhen we returned to the boat, Harris was sad and confused.\n\n\'What happened to you, Harris?\'\n\n\'Swans!\' he said.\n\nWe had left the boat near a swan\'s nest. When George and I were in Henley, Mrs Swan came back to the nest. She started to shout at Harris. Harris frightened her away. She went to get her husband, Mr Swan. Harris had a terrible fight with these two swans. Harris finally won the fight.\n\nHowever, half an hour later, Mr and Mrs Swan returned with eighteen other swans. There was a horrible fight. The swans attacked Harris and tried to pull him off the boat. They wanted to drown Harris and Montmorency!\n\nHarris fought with courage for four hours. In the end, the swans slowly swam away to die.\n\n\'How many swans were there?\' George asked.\n\n\'Thirty-two,\' said Harris, who was sleepy.\n\n\'But you said eighteen before,\' George said.\n\n\'No, I didn\'t. I said twelve. Do you think I can\'t count?\'\n\nWe never discovered the truth about the swans. We asked Harris about it the next morning. He said, \'What swans?\' He thought that George and I were dreaming.\n\nThat night Harris had trouble sleeping. He woke me up about twelve times during the night. He was looking for his clothes. George woke up, too.\n\n\'Why do you need your trousers? It\'s the middle of the night!\' George said.\n\nLater, Harris was looking for his shoes. Then he asked for his socks and his umbrella.\n\nWe woke up late the next morning. We had a small breakfast and we were ready to go. We agreed that we would row the boat, and not tow it. Harris said, \'George, you and J can row. I\'ll steer.\'\n\nI didn\'t like this idea, and I said, \'No, Harris. You and George row, so that I can rest.\'\n\nI was doing too much work on this trip. I always think that I work too much. It\'s not because I don\'t like work. I love it! I find it very interesting. I can sit and look at it for hours. You can\'t give me too much work. I like collecting it. My office is full of it.\n\nI\'m very careful with my work, too. Some of the work in my office has been there for years. It is in perfect condition. It isn\'t dirty or anything. That\'s because I take good care of it.\n\nHarris said, \'On this boat, I\'m the only one who works.\'\n\nGeorge said, \'You do nothing but eat and sleep, Harris. I\'m the only one who works. You and J are very lazy people.\'\n\nHarris laughed and said, \'George! Work! Have you ever seen George work?\'\n\nI agreed with Harris, George never worked.\n\n\'How do you know if I work, Harris? You\'re always sleeping, except at meal times. Have you ever seen Harris awake, except at meal times?\' George asked me.\n\nI agreed with George. Harris worked very little on the boat.\n\n\'Oh, please! I do more work than old J,\' Harris said.\n\n\'Well, it\'s difficult to do less work than old J,\' George added.\n\n\'Old J thinks he\'s a passenger and doesn\'t need to work,\' Harris said.\n\nAfter this discussion, I said to Harris, \'You and George row the boat up to Reading. At Reading I\'ll tow it.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12545, 11701),
(12548, 'Three men in a boat by Jerome K. Jerome Part 10 Three Men Out of a Boat We reached Reading at about II o\'clock. The river here is very dirty, so we moved on to Streatley. We stayed at Streatley for two days. We took our clothes to a laundry woman. We had tried to wash them in the river, as George told us. The river was so dirty that our clothes collected all the dirt from the water. The river became cleaner, but our clothes became dirtier. The laundry woman was very surprised to see such dirty clothes. She looked at them and said, \'This will cost you three times the usual price.\' We agreed and paid her. The river near Streatley and Goring is excellent for fishing. It is full of different types of fish. Some people sit and fish there all day. However, they never catch any fish. The local fisherman\'s guide book doesn\'t say anything about catching fish. It only says that the place is a good fishing area. And it is! You can see many fish swim past, but you can\'t catch them. When you go for a walk by the river, you can see hundreds of fish. They come and stand half out of the water. Their mouths are open for bread. If you go swimming, they come to look at you and disturb you. You cannot catch them, however. We passed by Wallingford and Dorchester. Both are ancient British towns. In the days of the Roman Empire, the Romans camped here and built fortifications. We spent the night at Clifton Hampdon, which is a pretty village. We finally arrived at Oxford and spent two excellent days there. Oxford is a beautiful town with its old university. Oxford is also full of dogs. Montmorency was very happy. He had eleven dog fights on the first day and fourteen on the second day. He probably thought he was in heaven. We left Oxford on the third day, to return home to London. When we left Oxford, it was raining. The rain continued without stopping. When it\'s sunny, the river is a dream. But when it\'s rainy, the river is brown and unfriendly. It rained all day. At first, we pretended to enjoy it. \'Well, this is a nice change. Too much sunshine is boring. Nature is beautiful even when it rains,\' I said. \'Yes,\' Harris said, \'it\'s good to see the river in all kinds of weather. The rain is good for you. I can\'t understand people who are afraid of a little rain.\' Harris and I sang songs and we were quite happy. George did not agree. He stayed under the umbrella. We put up the canvas cover before lunch. We left a little opening to see where we were going. We continued our trip for another nine miles. We stopped for the night at Day\'s Lock. We did not have a happy evening. The rain never stopped. Supper was not good. We were really tired of cold meat. We dreamt about our favourite foods. Harris talked about fish cooked in a special sauce. Harris gave his cold meat to Montmorency. He looked at it and turned his head. He seemed insulted by Harris\'s offer. He went to sit at the other side of the boat, alone. George said, \'Please don\'t talk about good food, until I finish this cold meat.\' We played cards after supper. After that, we had some hot water and whisky. George told us about a man he knew. This man had slept on the river in a wet boat, like ours. He got very ill and died ten days later. Of course, we began talking about other illnesses. After a while, I Harris said, \'I\'ve got an awful headache. It must be the rain.\' \'Well, I\'ve got a bad backache,\' I said. To make us feel happier, George sang to us. That made Harris and I cry, and it made Montmorency howl. There was nothing else to do, so we went to bed. We didn\'t sleep well at all. We were awake at five o\'clock the next morning. Our second rainy day was the same as the first. It rained all day. We moved slowly along the river. We agreed to continue our trip, even if it killed us. \'It\'s only two more days,\' Harris said. \'We\'re young and healthy. Maybe we\'ll be all right.\' We talked about our evening. \'With this weather, we can have dinner and take a walk in the rain. Or, we can have dinner and spend an hour in a pub,\' I said. \'That\'s not very exciting,\' said George. \'It\'s much more interesting to go to the Alhambra Theatre in London,\' said Harris. \'And then have supper at that little French restaurant,\' I added. \'But we have decided to stay and die on this boat,\' said George. \'However, there\'s a train that leaves Pangbourne after five o\'clock. It gets to London in time to eat something, and then go to the theatre.\' Everyone was silent. We didn\'t say one word. We looked at one another. Then, we got out the big bag and got our clothes ready. Twenty minutes later, three men and a dog were going to the railway station. We lied to the boatman at Pangbourne. We didn\'t have the courage to tell him the truth: we were running away from the rain! We asked him to take care of the boat until the next morning. \'If something happens, we\'ll write to you,\' we said, telling him a big lie. We reached Paddington Station at seven o\'clock. We went directly to the restaurant and had a small meal. Montmorency stayed at the restaurant, while we went to the theatre. \'We\'ll return at half past ten for the dog and for a good supper,\' I told the restaurant owner. The man at the ticket office of the theatre said, \'Oh, you\'re the famous acrobats from the Himalaya Mountains. You\'re late for the performance. Please use the side door.\' We explained to him that we were not acrobats. He understood and sold us three tickets. Our clothes probably looked a bit old and strange. At the Alhambra Theatre everyone looked at our clothes and smiled. Some people laughed. After the theatre, we went back to the restaurant. We enjoyed our delicious supper. After ten days of eating cold meat, we were thankful for this supper. We ate it without speaking. Then we sat back and felt happy and kind. Harris, who was sitting next to the window, pulled back the curtain. He looked at the wet street. It was rainy and dark. The wind was blowing. A few people walked past under their umbrellas. Harris took his glass and said, \'Well, we had a good trip, and I say thank you to Old Father Thames. But, I think we were right to come back when we did. Here\'s to Three Men well out of a boat!\' Montmorency stood on his back legs in front of the window.

So Mr Hiram B. Otis visited Lord Canterville. \'I do not live in Canterville Chase,\' Lord Canterville said to Mr Otis. \'I do not want to live there. The house has a ghost – The Canterville Ghost.\' \'I come from America,\' said Mr Otis. \'America is a modern country. I don\'t believe in ghosts. Have you seen this Canterville Ghost?\' \'No,\' said Lord Canterville, \'but I have heard it at night.\' \'I don\'t believe in ghosts,\' Mr Otis said again. \'No one has found a ghost. No one has put a ghost in a museum. And you haven\'t seen this ghost either.\' \'But several members of my family have seen it,\' said Lord Canterville. \'My aunt saw the ghost. She was so frightened that she was ill for the rest of her life. Also, the servants have seen it so they will not stay in the house at night. Only the housekeeper, Mrs Umney, lives in Canterville Chase. Mrs Umney lives there alone.\' \'I want to buy the house,\' said Mr Otis. \'I\'ll buy the ghost as well. Will you sell Canterville Chase? Will you sell the ghost?\' \'Yes, I will,\' said Lord Canterville. \'But, please remember, I told you about the ghost before you bought the house.\' Mr Hiram B. Otis bought Canterville Chase. Then his family came to England from America. He had a wife called Lucretia, three sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Washington, was almost twenty years old. He was good-looking and had fair hair. His two young brothers were twins. They were twelve years old. The daughter, Virginia, was fifteen years old. She had large blue eyes and a lovely face. Mr Otis took his family to live at Canterville Chase. The old house was in the countryside west of London. Mr Otis and his family travelled from London by train. Then they rode to the house in a wagon pulled by two horses. Canterville Chase was big and old. Trees grew all around the house. The Otis family wanted to stop and look at the outside of the house, but the sky darkened. A thunderstorm was coming. Rain started to fall, so the family went inside the house quickly. Mrs Umney, the housekeeper, was waiting for them by the front door. She was an old woman and wore a black dress and white apron. She lived at Canterville Chase and looked after the house. \'Welcome to Canterville Chase,\' said Mrs Umney. \'Would you like some tea?\' \'Yes, please,\' said Mrs Otis. The Otis family followed Mrs Umney into the library. There was a big table in the centre of the room and many chairs. Mrs Umney put teacups on the table, then she brought a pot of tea. The Otises sat in the library and drank their tea. They looked out of a large window at the rain. The rain was falling heavily and the sky was black. They heard thunder and they saw lightning. Mrs Otis looked around the room. There were many books on bookshelves. There were paintings on the walls. There was also a red stain on the floor. The red stain was by the fireplace. \'What is this red stain?\' Mrs Otis asked Mrs Umney. \'It is blood,\' answered the old housekeeper in a quiet voice. \'I don\'t want a blood-stain in my library,\' said Mrs Otis. \'Please remove the stain. Please clean the floor immediately.\' The old woman smiled. \'It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville. She was murdered by her husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575. The blood-stain has been here for over three hundred years. It cannot be removed.\' \'Nonsense,\' said Washington Otis. \'I have some Pinkerton\'s Stain Remover from America. It can remove any stain. Watch.\' Washington Otis took the stain remover from a bag. Pinkerton\'s Stain Remover looked like a small black stick. He rubbed the stick on the blood-stain. A minute later the floor was clean. The stick had removed the stain quickly and easily. Mrs Umney looked at the floor. She was frightened. No one had removed the blood-stain for three hundred years. Mrs Umney was very frightened. \'Pinkerton\'s can remove anything,\' said Washington Otis. \'The blood-stain has gone.\' Lightning flashed and lit the library. Thunder crashed over the house. Mrs Umney fainted. Mr and Mrs Otis ran across the library. They helped the old housekeeper who lay on the floor. Mrs Umney\'s eyes were closed and her face was pale. \'Mrs Umney! Mrs Umney!\' cried Mrs Otis. \'Can you speak?\' Mrs Umney opened her eyes. \'Trouble will come to this house,\' she said. \'I have seen the ghost. The ghost will come to you.\' All the Otises helped Mrs Umney to stand up. \'The ghost will come,\' she said again. \'You must not remove the blood-stain. You must not clean the library floor. The ghost will be angry.\' Then Mrs Umney went upstairs to her room. \'Let\'s look for the ghost,\' said the Otis boys. \'Let\'s look round the house.\' The Otises looked round the house together. But they did not see the Canterville Ghost.', 1, 1, 0, 'The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde', 12549, 11701),
(12552, 'The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde Part 2 That night the family went to bed early. The storm continued all night. Next morning they went into the library. The blood-stain had reappeared on the floor. \'I\'ll remove this blood-stain once more,\' said Washington Otis. \'Mother doesn\'t want a blood-stain in the library. I\'ll clean the floor again.\' He removed the blood-stain with Pinkerton\'s Stain Remover. The library floor was clean. But the next morning the stain had come back again. \'This is very strange,\' said Mr Otis. \'I\'ll lock the library door at night. No one can come into the library. No one can put a stain on the floor.\' \'I don\'t think Pinkerton\'s Stain Remover is bad,\' said Washington Otis. \'I think there really is a ghost. The ghost is making the blood-stain. The ghost puts the stain on the floor at night.\' \'We must find this ghost,\' said Mr Hiram B. Otis. \'It must stop making these stains. Your mother does not like blood on the library floor.\' That day the family went out. They walked around the countryside near Canterville Chase. They went to the nearby village. They looked at the old village houses. Then they walked back to Canterville Chase through the woods. It was a summer evening and the weather was fine. It was late when they got back to the house. The Otises were hungry and tired. After eating supper they went to bed. The bedrooms were upstairs. There was a long corridor upstairs. The bedroom doors were along this corridor. Mr Otis woke up after midnight. There was a strange noise outside his room. The sound was like metal chains. The chains were rubbing together. Mr Otis got out of bed and opened the bedroom door. He looked into the corridor. He saw the Canterville Ghost in the corridor. The ghost was an old man with burning red eyes. He had long grey hair and wore very old-fashioned clothes. There were chains on his hands and feet. He was rubbing the chains together so they made a noise. \'My dear sir, your chains make a terrible noise,\' Mr Otis said to the ghost. \'You must put some oil on those chains. Here is some Tammany Rising Sun Oil from the United States. Please put the oil on your chains.\' Mr Otis put a bottle of oil on a table in the corridor. Then he closed his bedroom door and went back to bed. The Canterville Ghost was very surprised. He has lived in Canterville Chase for three hundred years. Everyone was frightened of him, because everyone was afraid of ghosts. But this American gentleman was not afraid. The Canterville Ghost decided to work harder. He wanted to frighten the American. He made a terrible noise and shone a horrible green light in the corridor. Another door opened at the end of the corridor. Mr Otis\'s youngest sons came out of their bedroom. The two young boys had the pillows from their beds in their hands. They threw the pillows at the ghost. They laughed at the ghost. The ghost was amazed and upset. No one has laughed at him before. He was a ghost. Everyone is frightened of ghosts. No one has ever laughed at the Canterville Ghost before. The Canterville Ghost did not know what to do. He disappeared through the wall and the house became quiet. The ghost went to the secret room where he lived. He sat down on a chair. He thought about what had happened. He has frightened people for three hundred years. He has looked through windows and frightened the servants. He has knocked on bedroom doors. He has frightened people in their beds. He has blown out candles in the night. He has turned green and made noises with his chains. Everyone has always been frightened. No one has given him Rising Sun Oil to put on his chains. No one has thrown pillows at him. He was a very unhappy ghost.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12551, 11701),
(12554, 'The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde Part 3 Washington Otis removed the blood-stain in the library every day. Every morning the stain reappeared. But the stain was no longer the colour of blood. One morning it was brown. Another morning it was purple. Then it became bright green. The Otises laughed at the blood-stain. They looked for it every morning before breakfast. \'What colour is it today?\' asked Washington Otis. \'It\'s green!\' shouted the twins. \'It\'s green blood today.\' They laughed at the green blood-stain on the library floor. Virginia Otis did not laugh. The young girl was silent at breakfast. The blood-stain made her feel sad and she almost cried when she saw the bright green stain. She was sure that the ghost put the stain on the floor. She felt sorry for the ghost. \'The stain has been here for three hundred years,\' said Virginia. \'We have been here for three weeks. The poor ghost puts the stain on the floor every night. Can\'t you leave the stain there?\' But the others did not listen to Virginia. The second appearance of the ghost was on a Sunday night. The Otises had all gone to bed. Suddenly they were woken up. They heard a terrible crashing noise downstairs. The whole family ran out of their bedrooms. They ran downstairs. It was dark but Mr Otis and his eldest son carried candles. They heard another crashing noise in the hallway near the front door. There was a suit of armour in the hallway. This suit of armour was more than three hundred years old. It had fallen over and made a loud noise. The Canterville Ghost was sitting on the floor next to the armour. The ghost has tried to put on the suit of armour. He wanted to walk around the house and frighten the Otis family. But the metal suit was too heavy. The suit of armour has fallen onto the floor. The Canterville Ghost was sitting beside the armour. He was rubbing his knee. He had hurt himself. Mr Hiram B. Otis pointed a gun at the ghost. Washington Otis held his candle high in the air. The Otis twins laughed loudly. Virginia was afraid and stood beside her mother. They all looked at the Canterville Ghost. The ghost was very angry. He stood up and gave a loud shout. He blew out the candle in Washington Otis\'s hand. There was no light in the hall. Then the ghost ran up the stairs in the darkness. He stopped at the top of the stairs and laughed. He had a frightening laugh. Men\'s hair had turned grey when they heard him laugh. But the Otises were not afraid. \'Are you in pain?\' asked Mrs Otis. \'I have a bottle of Dr Dobell\'s medicine. It is good for stomach-aches and headaches. Please take the medicine.\' The ghost looked at Mrs Otis angrily. Then he disappeared in a green cloud and went back to his secret room. He was very unhappy. He had tried to put on the suit of armour, but it was too heavy. The armour had fallen over and the ghost has hurt his leg.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12553, 11701);

(12556, 'The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde Part 4 The ghost stayed in his room during the day. He came out at night to visit the library. He repainted the blood-stain every night. And every morning, Washington Otis removed the blood-stain with Pinkerton\'s Stain Remover. But the ghost had a problem. He had quickly finished all his red paint. Now his brown and purple paints were finished as well. So, sometimes he painted the blood-stain green, sometimes blue. The ghost made plans. He wanted to frighten the Otis twins. He planned to visit the twins in the night. He planned to turn himself green and make a horrible noise. He planned to visit the twins in their bedroom. He planned to touch them with his ice-cold hands in the dark. He left his secret room at midnight. The house was dark. He climbed the stairs and walked along the corridor. The twins\' bedroom was at the end of the corridor round a corner. He turned the corner. Suddenly he stopped. In front of him was a round face with a terrible mouth and burning eyes. Fire shone out of the mouth and eyes of this horrible face. It was the face of a ghost! The Canterville Ghost gave a shout and ran back to his secret room. He has never seen a ghost before and felt very frightened. Before daylight came, the Canterville Ghost felt better. Were there two ghosts in the house? He must find out. He must meet the second ghost. He went back upstairs and walked along the corridor towards the twins\' room. The second ghost was still there, but its eyes were no longer burning. He went up to it. He touched it. The head of the second ghost fell onto the floor. It was not a ghost at all. It was a head made from a large round vegetable called a pumpkin. The twins had put a candle inside it. There was a card on the floor.  THE OTIS GHOST THE ONLY TRUE CANTERVILLE GHOST  The twins had put the head in the corridor to frighten him. This made the Canterville Ghost very angry. What could he do? He could think of nothing at that moment, so he went back to his room. The ghost felt very weak and tired. He stayed in his room for five days. He did not repaint the blood-stain in the library. There had been a blood-stain on the library floor for three hundred years. Now the library floor was clean. After a week the ghost felt better. He decided to try once more to frighten the Otis twins. He planned to make his face look as horrible as possible. He waited until the middle of the night. Slowly and silently he walked to the twins\' bedroom. It was one o\'clock in the morning. The house was quiet. The door of the twins\' room was slightly open. The ghost took off his head and carried it under his arm. It is terrifying to see a headless ghost. He wanted to terrify the twins. He pushed open the door of the twins\' bedroom. The door banged against the wall. He planned to shout and hold his head in his hands. But a heavy jug of water fell from the top of the door. The twins had played a trick on him. He was soaked with water. The twins shouted and laughed. The ghost ran back down the corridor. He could not frighten the twins. He could not frighten anyone in the Otis family. Washington Otis came out of his bedroom. The ghost stopped running. Behind him, the twins ran down the corridor. They shouted – \'Boo!\' – in his ears and waved their arms. Washington Otis laughed at him. The ghost did not know what to do. He ran through the nearest door, went back to the secret room and lay down. He could not frighten anyone. He was a very unhappy ghost.', 1, 1, 0, 'The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde', 12555, 11701),
(12558, 'The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde Part 5 The Otises did not see the Canterville ghost at night again. The twins waited for him when it was dark. They put a rope across the corridor. They tied metal tins to the rope. But the ghost did not walk into the tins. Only Mr Otis came along the corridor. He fell over the rope and was very angry. Virginia Otis was also angry with the twins. \'Can\'t you leave the poor ghost alone?\' she said. \'Why do you want to hurt him? Why do you want to play tricks on him? He has lived here for a very long time. Leave him alone.\' The twins did not listen, but the ghost heard Virginia\'s words. The words gave him hope. One afternoon, Virginia went to the library. The library door was slightly open. She pushed the door wide open and quietly walked into the room. There was somebody sitting by the window. It was the Canterville Ghost! He was looking at the library window which was made of coloured glass. There were words painted on the glass. He was wearing his best clothes and had combed his long grey hair. \'I feel very sorry for you,\' said Virginia quietly. \'I\'m sorry that my brothers were not very kind to you. But you did try to frighten them.\' \'Yes I did,\' said the ghost. \'It is my job to frighten everyone who comes to Canterville Chase.\' \'You are very wicked, I know,\' said Virginia, \'Mrs Umney, the housekeeper, told us that you killed your wife.\' \'Yes I did,\' replied the ghost. \'But she wasn\'t very kind. And it wasn\'t very kind of her brothers to starve me to death.\' \'Starve you to death?\' said Virginia. \'Oh, poor ghost, are you hungry? Would you like a sandwich?\' \'No thank you,\' he replied. \'I never eat anything. But you are very kind. You are much kinder than the rest of your family. They are rude, nasty and unkind.\' \'Stop!\' cried Virginia. \'You are nasty and unkind too. You stole my paint box. You used my paints to make the blood-stain in the library. I never told anyone about it. But now I\'m going to fetch my father.\' She turned to go, but the ghost spoke again. \'Please do not go, Miss Virginia,\' said the ghost. \'I am so lonely and so unhappy. I do not know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I cannot.\' \'It\'s easy to sleep,\' said Virginia. \'You go to bed and close your eyes.\' \'I have not slept for three hundred years,\' said the ghost. \'I have not slept since I was murdered by my wife\'s brothers.\' Virginia walked across the library and looked at the old face of the ghost. It was a sad face. \'Poor ghost,\' said Virginia, \'how can I help you to sleep?\' \'Far away in the woods,\' said the ghost, \'there is a little garden. In the little garden the grass grows long and thick. There are many flowers and trees. A nightingale sings all night long. The bird\'s sweet song is beautiful and sad. The white stars and the pale moon look down on this little garden. It is very peaceful.\' Virginia\'s eyes were full of tears. She put her hands over her face. \'You mean it is the Garden of Death,\' she said quietly. \'Yes, the Garden of Sleep,\' said the ghost. \'It is very beautiful. There is peace and silence. There is no yesterday and no tomorrow. But only Love can open the door to the garden. For Love is stronger than Death.\' Virginia did not know what to say. She listened as the ghost spoke again. \'Have you read the writing on the library window?\' \'Yes,\' said Virginia, \'but I do not understand it.\' \'Look,\' said the ghost. \'Read the lines on the window.\' Virginia looked at the window and read the lines of poetry: When a golden girl shall weep For the ghost that cannot sleep, Then the dead at last shall die And in restful earth may lie. \'The words mean you must weep for me,\' said the unhappy ghost. \'Then the Angel of Death will let me rest. Will you help?\' \'What do I have to do?\' asked Virginia. \'You must come with me into the darkness. You will see strange things. You will hear strange voices, but nothing will hurt you. You are good and kind. The dark cannot hurt you.\' Virginia did not answer and the ghost waited. He has waited for three hundred years. This was the longest minute of all that time. \'I am not afraid,\' said Virginia at last. \'I will come with you into the dark.\' The ghost kissed her hand. His lips were cold like ice, but they burned like fire. The ghost held her hand and they walked to the wall of the library. The wall opened. There was darkness beyond the wall and a cold wind. Voices spoke out of the wind. \'Go back, Virginia. Go back before it is too late.\' Virginia walked into the darkness with the ghost.

The servant could not find Virginia so everybody searched the house. They looked everywhere but they could not find her. Mr and Mrs Otis were very worried. It was a summer evening and the sun did not set, so the family and the servants searched the gardens before it was dark. In the garden there were many trees and a deep pond. They looked in the pond. They looked in the trees. Then they asked people at the railway station. But no one saw Virginia. Mr Otis went to tell the village policeman that Virginia disappeared. But, by that time, it was dark and no one could search any more that night. None of the family wanted to eat or sleep. They sat in the library and waited. They hoped Virginia would return safely. They planned to search for Virginia again in the morning. It was midnight when the family decided to go to bed. They left the library and started to walk up the stairs together. Suddenly all the clocks in the house struck twelve and they heard a terrible noise. Thunder crashed outside the house and the Otises heard a dreadful cry. Strange music sounded inside the house and a door opened at the top of the stairs. Virginia stood in the doorway. She looked down the stairs at them. Her face was very pale and she carried a small box in her hand. \'Where have you been?\' Mr Otis asked angrily. \'Your mother has been very worried. You have frightened us all. You must never play a trick like this again.\' \'Except on the ghost,\' said the twins. \'You can play tricks on the ghost!\' \'Father,\' Virginia said quietly, \'I have been with the ghost. He is dead and now he can rest. He gave me this box of beautiful jewels before he died.\' She showed her father the small box. Inside was a necklace made of red stones. \'Where did you get this?\' asked her father. \'Where have you been?\' Mr Otis forgot to be angry. He was so pleased to see that Virginia was safe. \'Come. I\'ll show you,\' said Virginia. She turned back to the door at the top of the stairs. All of the family followed her. Washington Otis carried a lighted candle. Virginia led them along a secret corridor. They came to an old wooden door which was open. Beyond the door was a little room with a low ceiling. There was an iron ring in the wall and two chains. At the end of the chains was a body. Only bones remained. It was a skeleton. \'This is the body of Sir Simon de Canterville,\' said Virginia. \'He murdered his wife in 1575. Then his wife\'s brothers shut him in this room. He was given no food. Sir Simon starved to death. His ghost was in this house for three hundred years. But now he has found peace.\' The Otis family looked around the little room and did not know what to say. Virginia knelt on the floor beside the skeleton and began to pray. There was a funeral four nights later. The Otises buried the body of Sir Simon de Canterville in a grave among the trees. The Otises, Mrs Umney the housekeeper, and all the servants from Canterville Chase stood near the grave. Behind them were people from the nearby village. Many people has come to the funeral. Virginia carried white flowers. She looked up at the stars and the pale moon and the dark trees. She remembered what the ghost said about the Garden of Death. A nightingale began to sing. The bird\'s sweet song was beautiful and sad. Virginia smiled. \'God has forgiven him for murdering his wife,\' she said.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12559, 11701),

Her father had invited hundreds of people to the wedding at his huge house on Long Island, just outside New York. As the guests arrived, Don Corleone welcomed them all, rich and poor, with an equal show of love. Many of the guests had reason to be grateful to Don Corleone for their good luck in life, and they called him \'Godfather\' to his face. Standing next to him as he welcomed the guests were two of his three sons, Santino - or Sonny, as he was called - was the eldest. He was a tall, strong, good-looking man with thick brown hair. He looked uncomfortable in his white shirt and black suit. The second son, Fredo, was completely different. He was weak-looking and pale, with sad dark eyes and thin lips. The youngest son, Michael, was sitting at a table in the corner of the garden with his girlfriend, Kay. There was a gentle, innocent quality to him, with his soft dark eyes and full lips, but his army uniform suggested that this was not a weak man. Just a quiet one. He was embarrassed by all the singing and dancing, but he was quietly pleased that Kay was enjoying herself. This was the first time that she had met his family. \'Who\'s that funny little fat man over there?\' she asked, her eyes shining with excitement. \'He looks about sixty years old but he\'s dancing like a teenager.\' \'That\'s Pete Clemenza,\' Michael said. \'He\'s an old friend of my father\'s.\' \'And what about him?\' Kay looked at a large, ugly man who was sitting alone outside the house, talking to himself. \'He\'s very frightening.\' \'That\'s Luca Brasi,\' Michael smiled at Kay. \'He\'s waiting to speak to my father in private.\' \'Yes, but who is he?\' \'He helps my father sometimes,\' Michael replied quietly, looking at his food. Suddenly, the big man stood up and Kay looked away quickly, afraid that he was coming over to talk to her. But another man came up to the table instead. He had thin fair hair and blue eyes. Michael stood up and the two men hugged each other warmly. \'My brother, Tom Hagen, this is Kay Adams,\' Michael finally said. Tom Hagen shook Kay\'s hand, then whispered to Michael: \'My father wants to know why you don\'t go to see him.\' Michael sat down without speaking, and Tom walked away into the house, followed by Luca Brasi. \'If he\'s your brother, why does he have a different name?\' Kay asked Michael when Tom had gone. \'When my brother Sonny was a boy,\' Michael explained, \'he found Tom Hagen in the street. Tom had no home, so my father took him in and he\'s been with us ever since. He\'s a good lawyer. Not a Sicilian, but I think he\'s going to be a Consigliori! \'What\'s that?\' \'My father\'s chief adviser. Very important to the family.\' Suddenly, there came a loud, happy sound from the other side of the garden. The music and singing stopped. Connie, in her white wedding dress, left her husband and ran towards the gate screaming: \'Johnny! Johnny!\' She threw herself into the arms of a very handsome dark- haired man in a white suit, and covered his face with kisses. Then she led him by the hand through a crowd of excited, screaming girls, to meet her new husband, Carlo. Kay turned to Michael excitedly. \'You didn\'t tell me your family knew Johnny Fontane,\' she said. \'Sure. Do you want to meet him?\' Michael smiled. \'My father helped him to become famous.\' \'He did? How?\' At that moment, Johnny Fontane began to sing. \'Let\'s listen to the song,\' Michael tried to change the subject. \'Please Michael,\' Kay said impatiently, reaching across the table and squeezing his hand. \'Tell me.\' \'Well, Johnny is my father\'s godson. When Johnny was beginning to become popular, he had a problem with his boss, a band-leader. Johnny wanted to leave the band, but this man wouldn\'t let him. So Johnny asked my father to help. My father went to see the band-leader and offered him $10,000 to let Johnny go. He said no. The next day my father went to see him with Luca Brasi. One hour later, the band-leader let Johnny go. For $1,000.\' Kay looked confused. \'How did he do that?\' \'My father made him an offer he couldn\'t refuse. Luca held a gun to his head and my father told him that if he didn\'t agree to let Johnny go, Luca would blow his brains out.\' At first Kay didn\'t say anything. She thought Michael was joking. But Michael wasn\'t smiling. \'That\'s a true story, Kay,\' he said quietly. Then he saw Kay beginning to look worried, a little frightened, so he squeezed her hand and added quickly: \'That\'s my family, Kay. That\'s not me.\' *** \'I don\'t know what to do, Godfather.\' Johnny Fontane sat on the corner of the desk in Don Corleone\'s dark office and shook his head helplessly. Don Corleone was sitting in his leather chair, listening carefully to his favourite godson. He had, after all, travelled two thousand miles from California to be at his daughter\'s wedding. \'My voice is weak, \'Johnny went on. \'I can\'t sing as well as I used to. There\'s a part in a film that I want. It would be perfect for me. If I had this part, I\'d be a top star again. But the boss of the film company, Jack Woltz, won\'t give me the part. Can you help me?\' \'Go and rest,\' Don Corleone said. His voice was soft, but there was a rough quality to it that made everybody listen. It was a voice impossible to argue with. Something to do with the way he spoke without moving his mouth. \'In a month, this man will give you what you want.\' \'Too late,\' Johnny looked at his godfather unhappily. \'They start filming in a week.\' Don Corleone stood up and put a fatherly arm around Johnny\'s shoulder. \'I\'m going to make this man an offer he can\'t refuse,\' he said, leading Johnny towards the door. \'Now, go and enjoy yourself He kissed Johnny on the cheek, shut the door and turned to Tom Hagen, who had heard everything. \'What are we going to do with your daughter\'s new husband?\' Tom asked. \'Shall we give him anything important to do?\' \'No,\' Don Corleone replied. \'Give him something small. A betting shop, maybe. But never discuss the family business with him.\' \'Virgil Sollozzo called, \'Tom went on. \'He wants to meet you next week.\' \'We\'ll discuss that after you get back from California.\' Tom looked surprised. \'Why am I going to California?\' \'I want you to help Johnny. You\'re going to talk to this Jack Woltz. I want you to go tonight. And now, if there\'s no other business, I\'d like to go to my daughter\'s wedding.\' With these words, Don Corleone left Tom alone in the office, went outside, took his daughter by the hand and danced with her to the slow, Sicilian music.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12561, 11701),

Jack Woltz was giving a birthday party for one of his young girl stars in front of a lot of reporters. Tom waited patiently. Finally, Woltz walked up to him. He was a tall man with thick silver hair, expensive clothes and a hard, unfriendly face. \'OK, start talking,\' he said to Tom. \'I\'m a busy man.\' \'I was sent by a friend of Johnny Fontane,\' Tom said. \'He would be very grateful to you if you could do him a small favour.\' \'I\'m listening, \'Woltz said, busily signing papers. \'Give Johnny the part in that new war film you\'re going to make.\' Woltz stopped writing and laughed.

I\'ll wait for your call.\' He shook Woltz\'s hand and added, before leaving: \'By the way, I like your films very much.\' Tom was sure that, when Woltz realized who he worked for, he would call. And he was right. Late that afternoon, a car picked him up from the hotel and drove him out of the city to Jack Woltz\'s home in the country. Woltz\'s house looked like something from a film. It was a huge pink walled house surrounded by beautiful gardens, lakes and fields full of horses. Woltz welcomed Tom like an old friend, gave him a drink and showed him around. \'Why didn\'t you tell me you worked for Corleone, Tom?\' he asked. \'I don\'t like to use his name unless it\'s really necessary.\' Woltz took Tom by the arm. \'Come with me, Tom,\' he said. \'I want to show you something really beautiful.\' Woltz led Tom into a white building which was guarded by private detectives. Inside the building there were rows of horses. Woltz led Tom straight towards a beautiful horse with smooth black skin and a large, white, diamond-shaped mark between its eyes. \'You have an eye for beauty, don\'t you, Tom?\' Woltz said proudly. \'This is Khartoum, the greatest racehorse in the world. I bought him in England for $600,000.\' He looked lovingly into the animal\'s enormous dark eyes for a long time, talking to it softly like a lover, forgetting about Tom. Tom coughed with embarrassment. Woltz touched the horse one last time on the neck, then said to Tom: \'Let\'s go and have dinner.\' \'Corleone is Johnny\'s godfather,\' Tom began to explain at dinner. Although there were only two people at the table, the food was served by three waiters. \'To Italians, that\'s very important.\' I respect that,\' Woltz said. \'Just tell him he can ask me anything he likes. But not this. This is one favour I can\'t give him.\' \'He never asks a second favour when the first one is refused.\' Tom gave Woltz a warning look. \'Understood?\' This made Woltz angry. \'No,\' he said, pointing his finger across the table at Tom. \'You don\'t understand. Johnny Fontane never gets that film. The part is perfect for him. It\'d make him a big star. But I\'m not going to give it to him. And do you know why?\' He stood up and began to move slowly around the table towards Tom. \'I had a beautiful young actress. She was going to be a star. I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on her, singing lessons, acting lessons, dancing lessons. Then Johnny Fontane came along and took her away from me. I lost her. He made me look stupid, and that\'s something I can never forgive. That\'s why I\'ll make sure that Johnny Fontane never works in films. Now, you get out of here! And if your boss wants to frighten me, tell him I\'m no band-leader!\' Tom waited until Woltz had finished. \'Thank you for the dinner,\' he said quietly. \'Could your car take me to the airport now, please? Mr. Corleone is a man who likes to hear bad news immediately.\' Then without another word he left the table, took his hat from one of the servants and walked quickly out of the room. *** Jack Woltz was sleeping alone in his enormous bed. For some reason, this morning he woke up earlier than usual. The room was getting light. Everything was quiet. But he could feel that there was something wrong. He turned over and saw that there were wet red marks on his bedclothes. His night-shirt felt sticky, and there was a horrible smell in the room. He lifted the bedclothes off his body and looked down. His nightshirt was covered in blood. Without thinking, he sat up and pulled the bedclothes off his bed completely. The shock of what he saw nearly killed him. At first he couldn\'t breathe. He felt sick. Then, a moment later, he was filled with an animal fear. He opened his mouth and screamed.  For there, at the bottom of his bed, was the beautiful black head of his favourite racehorse, Khartoum. Somebody had cut it off during the night and put it in his bed while he was sleeping. It was stuck to the bed in a thick cake of blood, its mouth open, it\'s huge round eyes staring at him like pieces of half-eaten fruit. Jack Woltz\'s screams woke all the servants. Six hours later, Johnny Fontane received a phone call telling him that he had the part that he wanted in the film.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12563, 11701),
(12566, 'The Godfather by Mario Puzo Part 3 Virgil Sollozzo Virgil Sollozzo was excellent at killing people with a knife. He was a strongly-built man with dark eyes and a wide, cruel mouth, but today he was trying to be polite and friendly. He had an important favour to ask, which was why he had asked for this meeting with Don Corleone. \'Don Corleone,\' he smiled warmly. \'I need money to help me start a new business in drugs,\' he said. \'If you give me one million dollars, I can promise you between three and four million dollars in your first year. After that, you\'ll get even more.\' Don Corleone said nothing at first. He seemed to be thinking. He looked around the room, at Sonny and Tom Hagen, and at Clemenza and Tessio, his two oldest friends. They were all watching him quietly with serious faces, waiting to hear his reply. Finally, he turned back to Sollozzo. \'Why do you come to me?\' he asked in his usual rough whisper. \'I need a man who has important friends,\' Sollozzo said, lowering his eyes respectfully towards the Don. \'And what about the Tattaglia family? How much will they get?\' Sollozzo looked surprised. He didn\'t know that Don Corleone had discovered that he worked with the Tattaglias. He nodded his congratulations in the direction of Tom Hagen, who had obviously done his homework, and turned back to Don Corleone. \'Don\'t worry,\' he said. \'I\'ll pay the Tattaglias from my own money.\' Don Corleone didn\'t reply. He stood up slowly, took a bottle from the table and politely offered Sollozzo some more wine. Sollozzo watched with a worried look as the Don sat down next to him. Finally, Don Corleone spoke. \'I said that I would see you because I heard you were a serious man. You are a man I should respect. But I must refuse your offer. I will give you my reasons. It\'s true I have a lot of important friends in Government and the Law. But they wouldn\'t be my friends if they knew my business was drugs. Drugs is a dirty business.\' \'But nobody will know,\' Sollozzo said. \'I promise you the Tattaglias will make sure that nobody finds out.\' Don Corleone opened his mouth to reply but, before he could speak, Sonny said: \'Are you saying that the Tattaglias can promise that they\'ll ...?\' He didn\'t finish his question. He saw a cold look in his father\'s eye and stopped talking at once. Don Corleone turned back to Sollozzo. \'I apologize for my children,\' he said.\' They talk when they should listen. But Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I congratulate you on your new business, and I wish you luck. Your business is different from mine. We mustn\'t be enemies. Thank you.\' Don Corleone got to his feet, and everybody stood up too. Sollozzo was angry, but he hid his feelings from the others. He politely shook Don Corleone\'s hand and walked out of the room. Don Corleone waited for Tessio, Clemenza and Tom to leave the room, but called Sonny back. He stared up into his son\'s eyes for a moment, then said in an angry whisper: \'What\'s wrong with you? Has your brain gone soft?\' Sonny looked away, unable to look his father in the eye. \'I know you think this drugs business is a good idea. I know you think it\'s the business of the future, and I\'m just a stupid old-fashioned man. But never tell anyone outside the family what you\'re thinking again.\' Sonny looked surprised at first, and then a little angry. But he was too afraid of his father to argue with him. He lowered his head respectfully, turned round and left the room. Don Corleone immediately called Tom Hagen: \'Tell Luca Brasi to come in,\' he said. Brasi sat down alone in the office with Don Corleone. He had the terrible, frightening face of a killer, an enormous body that looked as if it was made of rock. But, as he looked at Don Corleone, his dark, unintelligent eyes were soft with respect. He loved his Godfather. And Don Corleone, knowing this, trusted Luca Brasi more than anyone he knew. \'I\'m worried about Sollozzo,\' Don Corleone said. \'I want you to find out what he\'s hiding, what he\'s got under his fingernails. Do you understand? Go to the Tattaglias. Pretend that you\'re not happy with our family and that you want to work for them. Then tell me what you find out.\' Luca Brasi asked no questions. He nodded once, lifted his mountainous body to its feet, and walked out of the room, proud to do whatever his Godfather asked him to do. *** For the next few weeks, Luca Brasi went regularly to the night-clubs controlled by the Tattaglia family. He made contact with Bruno Tattaglia, the youngest son and manager of the night-clubs. He told Bruno he was dissatisfied with the Corleone family. For a couple of months, nothing happened. Then one night, a few days before Christmas, Bruno told Luca he had a friend who wanted a private meeting with him. Who is he?\' Luca wanted to know. \'Just a friend,\' said Bruno. \'He wants to offer you something. Can you meet him here, after the club closes? Four o\'clock tomorrow morning?\' Luca went back to his room and got ready. He thought for a moment about calling the Godfather to tell him about the meeting, but decided not to. Don Corleone never talked over the phone. As well as this, his job was completely secret. Not even Sonny or Tom Hagen knew what the Godfather had asked him to do. So he took out a gun, hid it under his jacket, lay on the bed and waited. Luca arrived at the night-club just before four in the morning. The doorman had gone, but the door was open. Inside, the club was dark and empty, except for one man standing behind the bar. It was Bruno Tattaglia. Luca walked across to the bar and sat down. Bruno offered him a drink, but Luca shook his head. Moments later, a second man in a dark coat and grey hat moved out of the shadows and stood next to Bruno behind the bar. \'Do you know who I am?\' he said in Italian, his face in shadow. \'I know you,\' Luca replied. \'You\'re Sollozzo.\' \'We need a man like you,\' said Sollozzo. \'Strong and dangerous. I understand you\'re not happy with the Corleone family. Do you want to join me?\' \'If the money\'s good.\' \'$50,000 to start with.\' Luca nodded slowly, pretending to think. Sollozzo held out his hand. \'Do you agree?\' Luca looked at Sollozzo\'s hand but he didn\'t take it. Instead he took out a cigarette and put it in his mouth. Bruno moved forward with a lighter. Luca rested his hands on the bar, bent forward and lit his cigarette. Bruno put the lighter in his pocket, smiled at Luca and gently touched the back of Luca\'s hand. Then suddenly, without warning, he took Luca\'s arm with his other hand and held it tight. At the same moment, Sollozzo pulled out a knife and pushed it straight through Luca\'s hand. Before Luca could move, a third man stepped out of the shadows behind him and threw a thin cord around his thick neck. The cord pulled tight. He tried to fight, but he couldn\'t get his hands up to the cord around his neck. They had planned everything perfectly. While Sollozzo and Bruno Tattaglia held one hand down, his other hand was pinned to the bar with the knife. The cord pulled tighter and tighter, cutting into his throat until he finally stopped moving and fell slowly to the floor. But Sollozzo, Tattaglia and the other man did not let him go for several more minutes. They needed to be sure that Luca Brasi, the most dangerous man in the Corleone family, was dead. Later on the same day, Tom Hagen came out of a large shop carrying Christmas presents for his children. Sollozzo was standing in the street, waiting for him. \'Happy Christmas, Tom,\' Sollozzo smiled. Tom nodded nervously. \'I\'m glad I met you,\' Sollozzo continued in a friendly voice. \'I want to talk to you.\' \'I haven\'t got time, \'Tom said, and began to walk away. But two men stepped forward and stopped him. \'Make time, Consigliori,\' Sollozzo said, suddenly less friendly. \'Get in the car.\' Then, noticing the look of fear in Tom\'s eyes, added quickly: \'Don\'t be frightened. If I wanted to kill you, you\'d be dead already. Trust me.\' Without a word, Tom got into the car. *** Later that same afternoon, not knowing that Sollozzo had killed Luca Brasi and had kidnapped Tom Hagen, Don Corleone finished his work in the offices of his fruit company. He put on his coat and said to Fredo, who was reading a newspaper: \'Tell Paulie Gatto to bring the car. I want to go home.\' \'I\'ll have to get it myself,\' Fredo replied. \'Gatto\'s sick today.\' Don Corleone looked annoyed. \'That\'s the third time this month. Maybe we\'d better get another man for the job.\' Fredo jumped to his feet. \'No, I\'ll get the car. It\'s OK,\' he said. \'Paulie\'s a good boy. If he says he\'s sick, he\'s sick.\' Don Corleone waited inside the door until he saw Fredo park the car just outside. There was snow in the air and it was getting dark. He stepped on to the pavement and was about to get into the car when he decided to buy some fruit from the market on the other side of the street. He crossed the road and showed the fruit-seller the exact oranges and grapes that he wanted. He was so busy choosing fruit that he didn\'t see two men in black hats and long black coats turn the corner and walk quickly along the street towards him. He took the bag of fruit and paid the fruit-seller. Then he heard the sound of the two men running wards him. Without thinking, he dropped the bag of fruit and surprisingly quickly for a man of his age, back across the street towards his car. He had just reached the car when the two men pulled guns out of their coats and began to fire. Don Corleone was hit several times in the back. Fredo, on hearing the sound of guns, jumped out of the car; he was shaking so much with fear that he dropped his gun before he could use it. But his appearance was enough. On seeing him, the two men stopped shooting and ran away. Fredo looked down and saw his father\'s body lying in a pool of blood. Unable to believe what had happened, he sat down in the road next to his father, pulled off his hat and began to cry like a baby.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12565, 11701),
(12568, 'The Godfather by Mario Puzo Part 4 Sicilian Message Late that night, Michael and Kay were coming out of a theatre. Although they were staying in New York, Michael had told his family that he was in New Hampshire, over a hundred miles away. \'If I told my family we were in New York, we would have to see them right away,\' he told Kay. \'Then we wouldn\'t be able to be alone together.\' The night was freezing, and Michael and Kay held each other closely as they walked slowly along the crowded pavement. \'What do you want for Christmas?\' he asked Kay. Kay laughed and kissed his frozen cheek. \'Just you,\' she said. They walked a little further, then suddenly Kay stopped. Mike,\' she said, looking behind her, her face white with shock. \'What\'s the matter?\' said Mike, confused. She took his hand and led him back to a newspaper shop they had just passed. She pointed to a newspaper. Michael picked it up. \'VITO CORLEONE SHOT FIVE TIMES\' he read on the front page. Opening it, he saw a photograph of his father. \'KILLERS SHOOT UNDERWORLD BOSS\'. Without looking at Kay, he ran across the street to a public telephone and rang Sonny. \'Sonny?\' he said. \'It\'s Michael. Is he all right?\' \'We don\'t know yet, but he\'s hit bad, Mikey,\' his brother said. \'Where have you been? We\'ve been worried.\' Michael suddenly felt guilty about lying to his family about New Hampshire. \'I called. Didn\'t Tom tell you?\' \'No. But come home, Mikey. You should be with Mama. We need you.\' Michael put down the phone. Kay, who had followed him across the road, looked at him with tears in her eyes. Michael kissed her and hugged her tightly. Then, stepping away from her, he said:\' Go back to the hotel, Kay. I\'ve got to go home.\' *** As soon as Sonny had put down the phone, there was a knock on the door. \'They say he\'s dead, Sonny,\' said Pete Clemenza as he came in. Sonny took him roughly by the collar and threw him against the wall. \'Take it easy,\' Clemenza cried. Sonny took a deep breath and took his hands away. \'I\'m sorry,\' he said. And then asked: \'How\'s Paulie?\' \'Paulie wasn\'t there. He was sick.\' \'What do you mean? How many times has he been sick?\' \'I don\'t know, Sonny,\' Clemenza said, half afraid, half confused. \'Three, maybe four times.\' \'Listen. I don\'t care how sick he is. I want you to bring him to my father\'s house now. Do you understand?\' After Clemenza had gone, Sonny looked at his wife, who was standing nervously in the doorway, holding a crying baby. He hugged and kissed them both, trying to calm them down. Trying to calm himself down. Suddenly, the phone rang again. The voice on the other end was very soft, very gentle: \'We have Tom Hagen,\' the voice said. \'In about three hours we\'ll let him go. He\'ll have a message for you. Don\'t do anything stupid until you\'ve heard what he has to say. Your father\'s dead. Let\'s all keep clear-headed about this, OK?\' \'OK.\' Although he felt like shouting, Sonny spoke quietly. \'I\'ll wait.\' He immediately left his house and crossed the private road to the one where his father lived. He found his mother in the kitchen. \'Papa\'s hurt,\' he told her. \'I don\'t know how bad.\' His mother just said: \'I\'ll go and get ready. I might be able to see him.\' She didn\'t ask her son any questions. A Sicilian woman was taught never to ask men questions. Sonny took a mouthful of bread, went into his father\'s office and picked up the phone. \'Tessio? I want fifty good men here right away.\' \'What about Clemenza\'s people?\' Tessio asked. \'No. I don\'t want to use his men right now.\' Then he made a second call. This time it was to a friend of his who worked for the telephone company. \'Farrell? I want you to do me a favour. I want you to check two phone numbers for me. Give me all the calls they made and received over the last three months. It\'s very important. Give me the information before midnight.\' He gave him Paulie Gatto\'s and Pete Clemenza\'s numbers. Then he made a third call. He phoned Luca Brasi. But this time there was no answer. *** When Michael arrived, he found his father\'s house full of men he didn\'t know. He went into the living-room, shook hands with a sad-looking Pete Clemenza, kissed Tom Hagen\'s wife on the cheek, then went into his father\'s corner-room office. Sonny was sitting with Tessio, talking quietly. When he saw Michael, he stood up and ran towards him. \'I\'m really glad to see you,\' he said, hugging his brother warmly. \'Mama\'s at the hospital with the old man. He\'s going to be OK, thank God.\' But then he saw Michael sit down, and he stopped smiling. \'What are you doing?\' he said. \'I\'m talking important business with Tessio.\' \'Maybe I can help, \'Michael said. \'If you stay here, you\'ll hear things you shouldn\'t,\' Sonny warned him. \'The old man will kill me if he finds out.\' Michael stared at his brother. \'He\'s my father too,\' he said quietly. \'OK,\' said Sonny, annoyed at Michael\'s refusal to leave. \'You want to hear? Then I\'ll tell you. Whose head do we shoot off, Paulie\'s or Clemenza\'s? One of them betrayed the old man to Sollozzo. Who do you think it was?\' If Sonny was hoping to shock Michael, he didn\'t succeed. His younger brother just looked at him coldly and said: \'Not Clemenza.\' Sonny stared at his brother for a moment, then looked at Tessio with disbelief. \'I don\'t believe it. The college boy\'s right. It was Paulie. I had their numbers checked. While Paulie was sick, he got phone calls from Sollozzo\'s people.\' Michael got up and stood in front of his brother. \'Is there going to be a war, Sonny?\' he said. \'Of course there is. Unless the old man tells me different. Sollozzo\'s a dead man. I\'m going to hit all five families if I have to The Tattaglias are going to eat dirt.\' \'Wait, Sonny\' Michael said with a look of warning in his eyes. \'This isn\'t how Papa would do it.\' Just then, they heard loud voices from outside the door, and the sound of people laughing. Sonny Michael and Tessio rushed out of the room and saw Tom Hagen standing at the front door, hugging his wife and smiling. Sonny, Tom, Clemenza and Tessio sat in the Godfather\'s office, talking. They were planning to kill Sollozzo, wondering where Luca Brasi was, thinking about what to do if the Godfather died. Michael sat by the desk, listening to the conversation, but not permitted to speak. There was a knock at the door, and Paulie Gatto came in. He was blowing his nose, and looked very ill. \'There\'s a man at the gate,\' Paulie said, looking at Sonny. \'He\'s got something for you.\' Sonny sent Tessio out to see what it was. Then he smiled at Paulie. \'Are you OK, Paulie?\' he asked. \'Why don\'t you go to the kitchen and get something to drink? You look terrible.\' When Paulie had gone, Sonny turned to Clemenza. \'I want you to kill him tomorrow,\' he said. \'He betrayed the old man to Sollozzo. I don\'t want to see him again.\' Clemenza hid his surprise and just nodded. To him, it was just a job. Then Tessio came into the room. He was carrying something inside a large piece of brown paper. He gave it to Sonny, and stepped back. Sonny opened the paper. Inside, there was Luca Brasi\'s jacket. And inside the jacket, there was a dead fish. Sonny looked up at Tessio, confused. \'What\'s this?\' he asked. \'It\'s a Sicilian message,\' Tessio said in his deep but strangely gentle voice. \'It means that Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.\' ', 1, 1, 0, '', 12567, 11701),
(12570, 'The Godfather by Mario Puzo Part 5 Seeds of Revenge The next night, before going to visit his father in hospital, Michael had dinner with Kay in the hotel. They didn\'t talk much. Kay kept looking across the table at him, worried by his silence. Finally, he put down his glass of wine, stood up and said: \'I have to go.\' \'Can I come with you?\' Kay said, staring at her food. \'There\'ll be policemen at the hospital,\' Michael said, putting on his coat. \'Reporters too. I don\'t want to get you mixed up in this.\' Kay looked at him sadly. She understood that, since the shooting of his father, he was different. He was more distant from her. \'When will I see you again?\' she asked quietly. Michael found it difficult to look her in the eyes. \'Go back to your parents and I\'ll call you,\' he said. But Kay repeated her question: \'When will I see you again?\' This time, Michael looked at her. \'I don\'t know,\' he said, touching her gently on the shoulder. Then, without another word, he left her sitting alone at the table and walked towards the door. *** When Michael got out of the taxi, he was surprised to see that the street outside the hospital was quiet and empty. When he climbed the steps and went through the front door, he was even more surprised to find that there was nobody inside the hospital either. \'Where are Tessio\'s and Clemenza\'s men?\' he thought nervously as he took the lift up to the fourth floor. There was nobody outside his father\'s room. Michael opened the door slowly and walked inside. His father was lying in bed; glass bottles hung next to him. As Michael stood by the bed and looked down at his sleeping father, he heard a noise behind him in the doorway. He turned quickly. It was only a nurse. \'What are you doing here?\' she whispered angrily. \'I\'m Michael Corleone. This is my father. There\'s nobody here. What happened to the guards?\' \'Your father had too many visitors. The police came and made them all leave ten minutes ago.\' Michael thought quickly. He picked up the phone by the bed and told Sonny to send some people to the hospital at once. Then he told the nurse to help him move his father\'s bed to another room. When she complained, he said: \'You know my father? Men are coming here to kill him. You understand? Now help me, please.\' As Michael and the nurse were pushing the bed carefully through the narrow door of another room, they heard the sound of someone coming up the stairs. Michael closed the door quietly and looked through the window. He saw a man in a black hat and long black coat carrying flowers. Michael didn\'t know who he was, but decided that he didn\'t look like a killer. \'Who are you?\' he said, opening the door. The man turned round, surprised. \'I am Enzo,\' he said. \'The butcher.\' \'Listen, Enzo,\' Michael said. \'You\'d better get out of here. There\'s going to be trouble.\' Enzo lifted his head and looked at Michael proudly. \'If there is trouble, I stay here to help you. For your father.\' Michael didn\'t argue. He needed help. \'Go outside,\' he told Enzo,\' and stand in front of the hospital. I\'ll be out in a minute.\' He went back into the dark room and looked down at his father. \'It\'s all right, Papa,\' he whispered, softly touching his father\'s grey hair. \'I\'ll take care of you now.\' He bent down to kiss his father\'s hand and, when he looked up, he saw a tear in the corner of his father\'s eye. Michael found Enzo outside on the steps in front of the hospital. He threw Enzo\'s flowers away, turned up the collar of Enzo\'s coat and told him to put his hand in his pocket as if he had a gun. They waited nervously in the icy cold and dark. A few minutes later, the silence was broken by the soft sound of an engine moving slowly along the street. Michael and Enzo held their breath as a long black car appeared in front of the hospital gates and stopped. Shadowy shapes of men in hats moved inside the car. They seemed to be talking to each other. Then the car moved quickly away. Michael smiled at Enzo. \'You did well,\' he said. Enzo smiled and took out a packet of cigarettes, but his hands were shaking. Michael lit a cigarette for him. To his surprise, his own hands weren\'t shaking at all. He felt completely calm. Suddenly, there was the sound of police cars, and the street outside the hospital was filled with policemen. \'Good old Sonny,\' Michael smiled as he walked down the steps to meet them. What happened next took him completely by surprise. Two policemen took him roughly by the arms while a third policeman searched him. A huge police captain with a strong red face and white hair walked towards him. \'I thought I locked all you gangsters up,\' he said angrily to Michael. \'Who are you?\' Michael looked up into the police captain\'s fiery eyes and said, unafraid: \'What happened to the men guarding my father, captain?\' \'You little animal!\' the captain shouted. \'Don\'t tell me my business! Now, get out of here and stay away from this hospital!\' The policemen let go of Michael\'s arms, but Michael didn\'t move. \'I\'m not going until you put some guards outside my father\'s room,\' he said. The captain shouted to his men: \'Take him away!\' Michael stared at him coldly. \'What\'s Sollozzo paying you to betray my father, captain?\' At this, the captain lost all control. \'Hold his arms!\' he told the policemen behind Michael. Then, as they held him, he hit Michael hard in the face.  Before he could hit Michael again, another car suddenly arrived. It was Tom Hagen with a group of men to guard the Godfather. Tom saw Michael\'s face covered in blood and said: \'Do you want to report this?\' Michael had trouble talking, but he managed to say: \'That\'s OK, Tom. It was an accident.\' As he spoke, he didn\'t take his eyes off the police captain. He tried to smile. He didn\'t want to show anyone how he really felt at that moment.

(12572, 'The Godfather by Mario Puzo Part 6 Nothing Personal The entrance to the private road where the Corleone family lived was crowded with cars and men with guns. As Michael and Clemenza got out of the car together and walked in, Tessio came to meet them. \'Why all the guns?\' Clemenza asked. \'We\'ll need them,\' Tessio said. \'After Sollozzo tried to kill the Don at the hospital, Sonny got angry. We killed Bruno Tattaglia at four o\'clock this morning.\' Inside the house, Sonny was in an excited, happy mood. He held Michael\'s badly bruised face in his hands and laughed. \'Hey Mikey, you look beautiful!\' Michael pushed his brother\'s hands away and went to pour himself a drink to take away the pain. \'Hey, Tom,\' Sonny said, turning to the Consigliori. \'Listen to this. Sollozzo wants to talk. He wants us to send Michael to hear his offer.\' Tom looked worried. Sonny was talking and laughing as if it was all a joke. \'Perhaps we should hear what Sollozzo has to say,\' he said, \'We don\'t want another war.\' Sonny stopped smiling at once. \'No!\' he said, suddenly angry. \'No more. Not this time. No more meetings. No more Sollozzo tricks. I want Sollozzo dead. If not, we\'ll have a war!\' \'You\'re taking things too personally,\' Tom said, getting angry too. \'This is business.\' \'I don\'t want your advice,\' Sonny said. \'I just want you to help me win, all right?\' When everybody had calmed down, Tom explained to Sonny why he thought killing Sollozzo was a bad idea. \'Sollozzo\'s paying the police captain who hit Michael a lot of money. His name\'s McCluskey. He\'s agreed to be Sollozzo\'s bodyguard at the meeting. Now you must understand, Sonny, that you can\'t kill Sollozzo while he\'s with McCluskey. Nobody\'s ever shot a New York police captain. It would be a disaster. All the five families would come after you. All our important friends would disappear. We\'d have no friends in the world. We\'d be finished!\' Sonny listened to Tom carefully, and finally agreed to wait. But Michael, who had heard the whole conversation from his armchair said: \'We can\'t wait.\' Sonny and Tom stared at him in surprise, but Michael went on thoughtfully: \'We\'ve got to kill Sollozzo before he kills Papa.\' Tom thought for a moment, and then said quietly: \'Mike\'s right.\' \'But you just told me we can\'t kill him because of McCluskey!\' Sonny said, waving one arm angrily at Tom. \'They want to have a meeting, right?\' Michael began to take control of the conversation. \'Find out where it\'s going to be. If Clemenza can think of a way of hiding a gun there, I\'ll kill them both.\' There was a long silence as everybody looked at each other in disbelief at what they had heard Michael say. Then Clemenza laughed, closely followed by Sonny and Tessio. Only Tom looked serious. He knew that Michael wasn\'t joking. \'Hey,\' Sonny laughed, walking up and down in front of Michael, who sat strangely still in his armchair looking straight in front of him. \'What are you going to do? Nice college boy. You want to kill a police captain because he hit you in the face? This is business. You\'re taking it too personally.\' Tom smiled to himself. He had used those exact words to Sonny minutes earlier. Michael became angry. \'This is a policeman who\'s mixed up in drugs. He\'s dishonest.\' He turned to Tom. \'Listen, if he\'s killed, our friends in the newspapers will make a good story out of it. Isn\'t that true, Tom?\' Tom looked at Michael thoughtfully for a second before saying: \'You might be right.\' \'All right, all right!\' Sonny held up his hands. He gave Michael long, hard look, then shook his head as if he didn\'t want to hear what he was saying. \'OK, we\'ll do it. Clemenza will teach you everything you need to know. We\'ll take care of everything. When it\'s over, things\'ll be very bad, but that\'ll be our problem. You\'ll be out of it, Mikey. We\'ll make you disappear for a nice long holiday until things calm down.\' He looked at Michael, and added in a quiet voice filled with respect for his younger brother: \'You can do it, Mikey. I know you can.\' Michael smiled. He was beginning to feel a real Corleone at last. \'I learnt things from my father too,\' he said. *** Eventually, after a lot of nervous preparation, the meeting between Michael and Sollozzo was arranged. At the last minute, Sonny was able to discover where it was going to take place: a small family restaurant in the Bronx called \'Louie\'s\'. Michael waited alone, as agreed with Sollozzo, outside Dempsey\'s restaurant on Broadway. Finally, a large black car stopped in front of him, and Michael got into the passenger seat. In the back seat sat Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey, although this evening the policeman was not in uniform. Sollozzo put a friendly hand on Michael\'s shoulder and said: I\'m glad you came, Mike. We\'re going to solve all our problems tonight.\' \'I don\'t want anyone to try to hurt my father again,\' Michael replied in a quiet, cold voice. \'Don\'t worry,\' Sollozzo said warmly. \'He\'ll be safe. I promise. But please keep an open mind when we talk. I hope you\'re not a hothead like your brother, Sonny. You can\'t talk business with him.\' Just then, McCluskey moved forward in his seat and offered Michael his hand. \'You\'re a good boy,\' he said in a strong, friendly voice. \'I\'m sorry about the other night, Mike. Nothing personal, I hope. I\'m getting too old for my job, I guess.\' Without turning round, Michael shook the policeman\'s hand over his shoulder. \'And now I\'m afraid I\'ve got to search you,\' McCluskey said. \'So turn round please, on your knees\'. Michael did as he was asked. \'He\'s clean,\' McCluskey said at last, sitting back next to Sollozzo. Michael slowly put his hat back on his head, and stared out of the window with a dead look in his eyes. Half an hour later, McCluskey, Sollozzo and Michael were sitting at a small round table in the middle of a quiet restaurant. \'How\'s the Italian food here? \'McCluskey asked Sollozzo with real interest. \'Good,\' Sollozzo replied. \'The best in the city.\' When the waiter had poured wine into their glasses, Sollozzo began to talk to Michael in Italian. \'I have great respect for your father,\' he said. \'What happened between him and me is just business. His thinking is old-fashioned. Let\'s forget these disagreements. I want peace.\' Michael tried to reply in Italian, but he couldn\'t think of the words. So he spoke English instead. \'You must promise me that no one will try to kill my father again.\' Sollozzo looked at Michael in wide-eyed innocence. \'You think too much of me,\' he said. \'I\'m the one in danger, not your father. I\'m not as clever as you think. All I want is peace.\' Michael looked at McCluskey. The policeman seemed more interested in his food than the conversation. He turned back to Sollozzo, thought for a moment, then said: \'I have to go \'to the bathroom. Is that OK?\' \'No problem,\' said McCluskey. But Sollozzo didn\'t like it. When Michael stood up, he stopped him and searched him very carefully. Finally satisfied that Michael wasn\'t carrying a gun, he sat down again. \'Don\'t take too long,\' he said, staring at Michael moodily. Michael found the gun hidden in the toilet. Clemenza had done his job well. He pushed the gun into the top of his trousers, buttoned his jacket, took a few deep breaths to calm himself down, and returned to the restaurant. Sollozzo was sitting with his back to him, smoking a cigarette. McCluskey looked at Michael out of the corner of his eye, but went on eating. Sollozzo turned round. Michael walked back to his chair and sat down. Sollozzo began talking again in Italian, but Michael couldn\'t understand a word. He wasn\'t listening. All he could hear was the sound of his heart, the thunder of blood between his ears. Somewhere behind the restaurant there was the sound of a train. It was getting louder. McCluskey went on eating greedily. Sollozzo moved his face closer to Michael\'s to talk above the noise of the train. Now was the moment. Now! Michael jumped to his feet, pulled the gun from his trousers, pointed it straight at Sollozzo\'s head and fired. The bullet hit Sollozzo between the eyes. McCluskey stared at Sollozzo in surprise, as if watching something far away. He did not seem to realize his own danger. His fork was half-way to his mouth. He was just beginning to understand what was happening when Michael fired at him. The shot was bad. It hit McCluskey in the throat. He dropped his fork, put his hands to his neck and began to cough up food and blood. Very carefully, very coolly, Michael fired the next bullet straight into the policeman\'s brain. McCluskey stared at Michael for a second then fell forward, his head hitting the table with a crash. Michael turned away. He let the gun fall from his hand and, looking straight in front of him, he walked quickly out of the restaurant, round the corner and into the car where Tessio was waiting to drive him away.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12571, 11701),
(12574, 'The Godfather by Mario Puzo Part 7 Apollonia After the shooting of Captain McCluskey, the police took revenge on all five New York families. The Five Families War of 1946 had begun. But Michael wasn\'t there. He was hiding thousands of miles away, in Sicily. He was staying with Don Tommasino, a friend of his father\'s and a Godfather himself. In the evenings, Michael sat in a huge garden filled with flowers, drinking wine and hearing old stories about his family. During the day, he walked in the Sicilian countryside, dressed in old clothes. Two bodyguards, Fabrizio and Calo, went everywhere with him, carrying guns over their shoulders. Michael often thought of Kay during these long walks in the white hot sun. He felt sad and guilty that he had left America without saying goodbye to her. One morning, seven months after arriving in Sicily, Michael decided to walk into the mountains past the hilltop town of Corleone. He walked with his two bodyguards along dusty country roads, past fruit-trees and fields of flowers. The hot, still air was rich with the smell of oranges. Along the way, they met a group of girls and children picking flowers. They stopped to watch them pass. One girl in a simple dress with a basket over her arm stopped in front of Michael to pick a small pink flower. Michael watched her, studying the way that her long, brown hair shone in the sunlight and hung around her face. Suddenly, the girl lifted her head and looked at him. She had large brown eyes, and her heart- shaped mouth was red with the juice of grapes. Michael felt weak, as if hit by lightning. He had never seen anyone so lovely. The girl lowered her eyes with a shy smile, ran back to join her friends and disappeared down the road. Fabrizio noticed the look on Michael\'s face and laughed. \'Let\'s go and find out who she is,\' he suggested. Michael agreed, and followed Fabrizio and Calo down a narrow path towards the village where the girls and children had gone. In the village, they sat at a table outside a small cafe. The owner of the cafe was a short man with white hair and a dark moustache. He was a friendly man and he smiled as he served them, not worried at all by the fact that his customers carried guns. When Fabrizio asked the cafe owner about the beautiful girl they had seen picking flowers, and described her to him, a strange thing happened. The man stopped smiling, looked at the three men angrily, and disappeared inside the cafe. Fabrizio followed him inside and, moments later, ran out looking nervous. \'Quick, we must go,\' he said to Michael. \'He\'s really angry. The girl\'s his daughter.\' But Michael didn\'t move. He stared at Fabrizio and said: \'I want to speak to him.\' Fabrizio quickly drank some wine, picked up his gun and went inside to bring the man to Michael. The cafe owner appeared with two young, strong-looking men at his side. They were his sons. He looked down at Michael without speaking, a hard look in his eye. Michael spoke to him quietly. \'I\'m sorry if I made you angry,\' he said. I\'m an American hiding in Sicily. My name\'s Michael. You can tell the police, and make a lot of money. But then your daughter would lose a father instead of getting a husband. With your agreement, I would like to meet your daughter. With all respect.\' The cafe owner\'s face softened. He looked with interest at Michael, this young man with the strange mixture of softness and confidence in his voice. He noticed that the two men with guns looked at this young man with great respect. He was obviously important, and probably rich. \'Come on Sunday afternoon,\' he said. \'My name is Vitelli and my house is up there in the hills, above the village.\' \'And what\'s you daughter\'s name?\' Michael said, standing up and shaking the man\'s hand. \'Apollonia, \'the cafe owner smiled. *** That Sunday, Michael, dressed in his best clothes, brought presents for Apollonia and all her family. He gave Apollonia some jewellery. He began to visit the family home regularly after that. One evening, at the dinner table, he noticed that she was wearing the jewellery he had given her. It was her way of saying that she liked him. He invited her for a walk in the country, and she agreed. They walked side by side, but they were careful not to touch each other. They were not alone. All the women in Apollonia\'s family walked behind them, followed by Calo and Fabrizio, carrying their guns. Two weeks later, Michael and Apollonia got married. Compared to his sister\'s wedding to Carlo in New York two years earlier, it was a simple Sicilian wedding. Apollonia wore white while all the other women wore black. The villagers stood in the streets and threw flowers as the couple passed on foot from the church to Apollonia\'s house in the hills. The wedding guests walked behind the couple and, behind the guests, there was a band of musicians. The wedding party went on until midnight. Then Michael took Apollonia away, and drove her to Don Tommasino\'s house outside Corleone. *** Two years after their wedding, Connie and Carlo Rizzi were not happily married. Carlo drank a lot and saw other women. Connie shouted at him all the time, and Carlo used to hit her. One day, Sonny visited his sister and saw her face was covered in bruises. He became very angry and, although Connie tried to stop him, he rushed away to find Carlo. He found Carlo sitting outside the betting shop where he worked. Sonny jumped out of his car and ran quickly towards him. Carlo tried to escape, but Sonny dived and caught him by the ankles, pulling him down with a crash. Then, while Carlo was still on the ground, Sonny kicked and hit him, screaming at him all the time. Carlo didn\'t try to fight. He stayed on his knees and covered his head with his hands. Finally, Sonny grew tired. He looked down at Carlo\'s bruised and bloody body and said: \'If you ever touch my sister again, I\'ll kill you!\' A few weeks later, the telephone rang in the kitchen of Don Corleone\'s house. Sonny was called to the phone. It was Connie, and she was crying. Carlo had hit her badly, and she wanted to come home. As he listened, Sonny\'s face went red and he began to shake. \'I\'m coming right over,\' he told his sister. \'Just wait there.\' \'Please Sonny, don\'t ...\' Connie began, but Sonny put down the phone and ran straight out of the house. Tom Hagen tried to stop him, but Sonny refused to listen. As Sonny drove quickly out of the gates, Tom told two bodyguards to follow him. Between Long Island and the City of New York, there was a kind of bridge. Before anyone could cross, they had to stop at the tollbooth and pay. When Sonny arrived at the bridge, only one tollbooth was open. He had to wait because another car was in front of him. Sonny impatiently looked for some money in his jacket pocket. The car in front of Sonny drove forward a little way and stopped. Sonny drove up to the tollbooth. He gave the man inside his money and tried to drive away, but the car was still in front of him. The man in the tollbooth dropped the money and bent down to pick it up. From the corner of his eye, Sonny noticed something moving in the empty tollbooth on his right. He looked round and saw four men standing in the windows looking at him. At the same moment, two men got out of the car in front and began to walk towards him. They were carrying machine-guns. Sonny thought about driving backwards, but he was too late. In the second before anything happened, Sonny knew that he was a dead man. There was a sudden thunder of noise, and bullets crashed through the windows of his car from all directions. Before Sonny could dive for cover, he was hit several times in the chest and head. But he was a strong man. He refused to die quietly. He pulled himself across the seat, opened the door and half jumped, half fell out of the car. He tried to pull his gun from his jacket, but bullets continued to hit him. At last, with a wild and angry look on his face, he fell to the ground in a pool of blood and stopped moving. By the time the bodyguards that Tom had sent to follow him arrived, Sonny Corleone, eldest son of Vito Corleone, was dead, and his killers were gone. *** Later that night, Tom Hagen sat alone in Don Corleone\'s dark office, drinking. He couldn\'t believe that Sonny was dead. He heard the door behind him open and close. Turning round, he saw Don Corleone. He looked very old and tired as he walked stiffly across the room. He had lost weight, and his clothes hung loosely from his body. \'Give me some wine,\' he said as he lowered himself slowly into his favourite leather armchair. He waited while Tom poured him a drink, then half spoke, half whispered: \'My wife was crying before she fell asleep. Outside my window, I saw Tessio and Clemenza coming to the house and it\'s midnight. So, Tom, I think you should tell your Don what everybody already knows.\' \'I was about to come up and tell you, \'Tom said. \'But you needed a drink first.\' \'Yes,\' Tom looked down, ashamed. \'You\'ve had your drink. You can tell me now.\' Tom looked up, his eyes filled with tears. \'They shot Sonny,\' he said, his voice shaking. \'He\'s dead.\' Don Corleone closed his eyes. For a second he, too, seemed about to cry. But when he opened his eyes again, they were dry. \'I want no revenge,\' he said sadly. \'I want you to arrange a meeting with the heads of the five families. This war stops now.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 12573, 11701),
(12576, 'The Godfather by Mario Puzo Part 8 A Good American Wife In the first weeks of married life, Michael and Apollonia went for walks in the hills and drove around the countryside in their small black car. But news of the wedding had reached Michael\'s enemies. Don Tommasino told Michael that it was too dangerous for him to leave the house. He put men with guns around the house to guard him, and told Fabrizio and Calo to stay with Michael all the time. Although he was a prisoner in his home, Michael wasn\'t too unhappy. He had Apollonia. He spent the time teaching her how to speak English and how to drive the car. One morning, Don Tommasino came home to tell Michael that Sonny was dead. It wasn\'t safe for Michael to stay in the house any more. He had found a safe house outside Syracuse, and he would have to leave at once. Apollonia could live with her parents for a short time. She could join him later. The next morning, Michael stood at his bedroom window and saw Fabrizio sitting in a garden chair. \'Get the car,\' Michael called down. \'I\'m leaving in five minutes.\' \'Is your wife coming with you?\' Fabrizio asked. \'No, I want you to take her to her father\'s house until I\'m safe.\' Michael washed, then went downstairs to the kitchen, where he found. Calo having breakfast. \'Where\'s Apollonia?\' Michael asked. \'She\'s in the car,\' Calo said, his mouth full of bread. \'You\'ll get a surprise. She\'s driving it alone. She\'ll make a good American wife.\' Michael smiled and went outside. Apollonia was sitting in the car, her hands on the wheel. She laughed and waved at him. But Michael was annoyed to see Fabrizio about to disappear through the garden gates. \'Fabrizio. Where are you going?\' Michael called. Fabrizio looked over his shoulder at Michael, then continued to walk quickly away. Michael watched him go, confused at first. Then he looked at the car. Suddenly, without thinking, he realized there was danger. He shouted to Apollonia: \'No! No!\' But she never heard him. There was a loud explosion and Michael was thrown to the ground. When he looked up, pieces of burning car were lying all over the garden. The bomb, which someone had intended for him, had killed his beautiful, innocent wife instead.  The secret meeting between the heads of the five New York families and all the other important families in America took place in a large room above a bank. Everybody sat around a large table, each head with his Consigliori sitting close behind. Don Corleone, who had invited them all, was the first to stand up and speak. \'How did things get so far?\' he said. \'It\'s so unnecessary.\' He looked at the small man with dark, oily hair and shadows under his eyes who was sitting opposite him. \'Tattaglia, you\'ve lost a son. I\'ve lost a son too. Why can\'t we stop this foolish war now before more people die?\' A handsome man with silver hair who sat at one end of the table began to speak. This was Barzini. \'We all know Don Corleone is an honest man,\' he said. \'We can trust him.\' \'Yes,\' Tattaglia said to Barzini. \'He has many important friends. But he refused to share them with us.\' \'I only ever refused to help you once,\' Don Corleone looked at Tattaglia. He was thinking about the meeting with Sollozzo. \'I refused to help you because I don\'t like the drugs business.\' \'Times have changed,\' Barzini said. \'A man who refuses to help his friends is not a true friend. Don Corleone must share his important friends in Law and Government with us. We will pay him well for his help, of course.\' The Godfathers talked for a long time. Finally Don Corleone said: \'I\'m a man you can trust. I\'ll do whatever I can for peace.\' \'Then we all agree,\' Barzini smiled. \'The drugs business will be permitted, but controlled. And Don Corleone will share his important friends with us.\' \'If Don Corleone promises not to take revenge on us for his son\'s death,\' Tattaglia said. Don Corleone looked sadly at Tattaglia. \'Is revenge going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? I promise, there will be no revenge. But only if my youngest son is permitted to come back safely. He has had to live abroad since that Sollozzo business. I want him home. But I warn you, if anything happens to my son - if he mysteriously falls off the boat on his way home, or if he\'s hit by lightning after he returns - then I will blame some of the people in this room. That, I will not forgive. But if my son is permitted to return safely to New York, then I promise, I will not be the one to break the peace we have made here today.\' At this, he stood up and opened his arms to Tattaglia. Tattaglia stood up too, and the two men walked around the table. They met behind Barzini\'s chair and hugged each other warmly. Then all the Godfathers in the room stood up and began to hug and kiss each other, congratulating each other on the end of the war.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12575, 11701),

Kay stopped as if she had seen a ghost. \'Michael,\' she said. \'How long have you been back?\' \'About a year,\' he said quietly. Then, walking slowly towards her, he said: \'It\'s good to see you Kay\' They walked together through the park, hands in pockets, a little shy with each other after so much time. \'I\'m working for my father now,\' Michael explained. \'He\'s been sick. Very sick.\' \'But you\'re not like him,\' Kay replied. \'I thought you weren\'t going to become a man like your father.\' \'As I\'ve grown older, I\'ve learnt to respect him more. He\'s just an ordinary man who loves his family, that\'s all.\' \'Ordinary men don\'t have other men killed,\' Kay said. \'Listen, Kay,\' Michael stopped walking and looked her in the eyes. \'In five years\' time, my family will have no more problems. We\'ll be a lawful, respectable family. Trust me. That\'s all I can tell you about my business.\' Kay\'s eyes filled with tears. \'Michael, why did you come here?\' she said. \'What do you want with me after all this time? You didn\'t call. You didn\'t write ...\' \'I came here because I need you.

What\'s important is that we have each other. That we have children. Kay, I need you. And I love you.\' As Michael was speaking, Kay kept looking away. She didn\'t know what to say. Michael had changed. He was different now. There was something cold about him, something hard... But in the end, this didn\'t matter. Before she could answer him, the large black car drove up and stopped next to them. Michael opened the back door for her and waited. In her heart, Kay realized that she still loved him.

(12581, 'The Godfather by Mario Puzo Part 10 Many Changes As months turned into years, there were many changes. Michael and Kay got married and had two children. Connie and Carlo Rizzi moved with their children into a house on Long Island, to be near the rest of the family. Fredo was sent to Las Vegas, where the Corleones had bought one hotel and were planning to buy many more. Barzini was taking advantage of the peace between the five families, and was beginning to take over a lot of the Corleone family business in New York. Tessio and Clemenza wanted to fight Barzini before he became too strong, but Michael, who had spent long hours talking to Tom Hagen and his father, learning the family business, told them to be patient. At first, Tessio and Clemenza didn\'t like taking orders from Michael. They tried to talk to Don Corleone instead. But the old man said: \'Do you trust me?\' \'Yes, Godfather,\' Tessio and Clemenza replied. \'Then be a friend to Michael He\'s head of the family now. Do as he says\' One afternoon, Michael sat in the garden with his father Don Corleone had put on a lot of weight and moved very slowly. He spent most of his time in the garden, looking after his plants, or just sitting under a tree, drinking wine, thinking about the past. But his mind was still sharp Michael always came to him for advice. \'Be careful of Barzini,\' he told Michael \'He\'ll move against you first. He\'ll arrange a meeting with someone that you trust. He\'ll promise you safety. But at that meeting, he\'ll kill you\'. Don Corleone drank some red wine, and suddenly changed the subject \'Are you happy with your wife and children?\' he asked. \'Very happy,\' Michael said softly. He wanted to hear more about Barzini, but he respected and loved his father too much to hurry him. \'That\'s good,\' said Don Corleone. He looked around the garden for a moment with a sad look in his eyes, then said: \'I\'m sorry I can\'t stop thinking about Barzini. It worries me. I always thought Sonny would be head of the family. I never wanted this for you. There just wasn\'t enough time. Michael gently touched his father\'s arm. \'Don\'t worry, Father,\' he said. \'I\'ll take care of it.\' Don Corleone nodded, smiled to himself, then looked suddenly serious as if he had forgotten to tell Michael something important. \'What\'s the matter, Father?\' Michael asked. \'Listen,\' Don Corleone raised one finger. \'Whoever comes to you with this Barzini meeting - he\'s the traitor. Don\'t forget that\'. Then, standing with great difficulty, he touched Michael lovingly on the cheek and walked slowly back to the house, out of the sun. One Sunday morning, while the women were at church, Don Corleone was playing with his grandson among his tomato plants in the garden. As he tried to run away from the little boy who was chasing him, he suddenly found it hard to breathe. It was as if the sun had come down very close to his head. He stopped running and started to cough as he tried to get air into his chest. The little boy laughed, thinking this was part of the game. Don Corleone bent forward, coughing more and more, and then he felt it: an explosion of fire inside his chest. With a cry of pain, he fell back among his tomato plants, dead.

Clemenza\'s close friend, Rocco Lampone, was sitting with his eyes closed in a large hotel, while a man gave him a shave. Two other men who worked for the family were checking their machine-guns in a small, apartment room somewhere in a cheap part of the city. *** Kay stood in the church, Connie\'s baby sleeping in her arms. The priest spoke Latin and touched the baby\'s cheeks and mouth with water. Then he asked Michael: \'Do you believe in God the Father, the Maker of Heaven and Earth? Do you believe in Jesus Christ?\' Michael said: \'I do.\' *** Albert Neri was standing on the pavement in his policeman\'s uniform. He was talking to the driver of a car which was parked in front of the Plaza Building, trying to make him move away. The driver shook his head and refused to move. Pete Clemenza was running up a lot of stairs in a dark hotel, the flower-box under his arm. His fat face was hot and red, and he was very short of breath. Rocco Lampone checked his face in the mirror, paid the man in the hotel who had given him the shave and calmly walked out of the door. The two men with machine-guns looked at each other and, without a word, walked out of their apartment. *** The baby in Kay\'s arms woke up and began to cry. He didn\'t like the water on his face. *** Barzini appeared at the top of the steps of the Plaza Building with his bodyguard.

Pete Clemenza reached the top of the stairs and rested against a wall outside a lift, completely out of breath. *** \'Michael Francis Rizzi,\' the priest spoke to the crying baby. \'Do you refuse Satan, and everything that Satan does?\' Clemenza waited outside the lift.

It was Cuneo, one of the New York Godfathers who had been at the meeting with Don Corleone three years before.

He pointed it at Cuneo and fired. \'I do refuse Satan,\' Michael spoke quietly to the priest, answering for the baby. \'And everything that Satan does.\' The baby went on crying. *** A man in a white suit walked past the desk where Rocco Lampone was waiting. He was on his way out of the hotel. This was Stracci, another New York Godfather. As he was half-way through the revolving doors, Lampone ran from the desk and locked the door to stop it turning. Stracci was caught inside. He tried to push, but the doors wouldn\'t move. He hit the glass with his hands. He turned round and found himself face to face with the end of Rocco Lampone\'s gun.

Then the gunmen left as suddenly as they had appeared, leaving behind them a smoke-filled room and two dead bodies in a pile of torn and bloody bedclothes. The priest held a silver spoon above the baby\'s head, and let drops of water fall on to the baby\'s face. \'In Nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spintus Sancti,\' the priest said. Barzini\'s bodyguard ran down the steps of the Plaza Building and called to the policeman, who was writing something in his notebook. The policeman put away his notebook, took out his handgun, and shot the bodyguard dead. The driver of the car put up his hands but there was no pity in Albert Neri\'s heart. He killed him too. Barzini, who was halfway down the steps, turned and began to walk quickly back up towards the building. He was a proud man. He never liked to run too fast for anything, not even when his life was in danger. This gave Neri the time that he needed to go down on one knee, point his gun carefully up at Barzini, and shoot him three times in the back. Barzini stopped, as if in surprise, then fell backwards down the steps. Suddenly, inside the church, the baby stopped crying. \'Michael Rizzi, go in peace,\' the priest said. \'And God go with you always. Amen.\' \'Amen,\' Michael Corleone said softly, and lowered his eyes knowing that, by now, all his enemies were dead.', 1, 1, 0, '', 12584, 11701),

(30835, '\nThe Luncheon by Somerset Maugham\n\nI caught sight of her at the play and in answer to her beckoning I went over during the interval and sat down beside her. It was long since I had last seen her and if someone had not mentioned her name I do not think I would have recognized her. She addressed me brightly.\n\n\"Well, it\'s many years since we first met. How time flies! We are not getting any younger. Do you remember the first time I saw you? You asked me to luncheon.\"\n\nDid I remember?\n\nIt was twenty years ago and I was living in Paris. I had a tiny apartment in the Latin Quarter and I was earning barely enough money to keep body and soul together. She had read a book of mine and had written to me about it. I answered, thanking her, and presently I received from her another letter saying that she was passing through Paris and would like to have a chat with me; but her time was limited and the only free moment she had was on the following Thursday. She asked me if I would give her a little luncheon at Foyot\'s. Foyot\'s is a restaurant at which the French senators eat and it was so far beyond my means that I had never even thought of going there. But I was flattered and I was too young to say no to a woman. I had eighty francs to live on till the end of the month and a modest luncheon should not cost more than fifteen. If I cut out coffee for the next two weeks I could manage well enough.\n\nI answered that I would meet her at Foyot\'s on Thursday at half past twelve.\n\nShe was not so young as I expected and in appearance imposing rather than attractive. She was in fact a woman of forty, and she gave me the impression of having more teeth, white and large and even, than were necessary for any practical purpose. She was talkative, but since she seemed inclined to talk about me I was prepared to be an attentive listener. I was startled when the menu was brought, for the prices were a great deal higher than I had expected. But she reassured me.\n\n“I never eat anything for luncheon,\" she said.\n\n\"Oh, don\'t say that!\" I answered generously.\n\n\"I never eat more than one thing. I think people eat too much nowadays. A little fish, perhaps. I wonder if they have any salmon.\"\n\nWell, it was early in the year for salmon and it was not on the menu, but I asked the waiter if there was any. Yes, they had a beautiful salmon, it was the first they had had. I ordered it for my guest. The waiter asked her if she would have something while it was being cooked.\n\n\"No,\" she answered, \"I never eat more than one thing. Unless you had a little caviar.\' I never mind caviar.\"\n\nMy heart sank a little. I knew I could not afford caviar, but I could not tell her that. I told the waiter by all means to bring caviar. For myself I chose the cheapest dish on the menu and that was a mutton chop.\n\n\"I think you\'re unwise to eat meat,\" she said. \"I don\'t know how you can expect to work after eating heavy things like chops. I never overload my stomach.\"\n\nThen came the question of drink.\n\n\"I never drink anything for luncheon,\" she said.\n\n\"Neither do I,\" I answered promptly.\n\n\"Except white wine,\" she went on as though I had not spoken. \"These French white wines are so light. They are wonderful for the digestion.\"\n\n\"What would you like?\" I asked her.\n\n\"My doctor won\'t let me drink anything but champagne.\" I think I turned a little pale. I ordered half a bottle. I mentioned casually that my doctor had absolutely forbidden me to drink champagne.\n\n\"What are you going to drink, then?\"\n\n\"Water.\"\n\nShe ate the caviar and she ate the salmon. She talked gaily of art and literature and music. But I wondered what the bill would come to. When my mutton chop arrived she said:\n\n\"I see that you\'re in the habit of eating a heavy luncheon. I\'m sure it\'s a mistake. Why don\'t you follow my example and just eat one thing? I\'m sure you\'d feel much better then.\"\n\n\"I am only going to eat one thing,\" I said, as the waiter came again with the menu. She waved him aside with a light gesture.\n\n\"No, no, I never eat anything for luncheon. Just a bite, I never want more than that. I can\'t eat anything more unless they had some of those giant asparagus. I should be sorry to leave Paris without having some of them.\"\n\nMy heart sank. I had seen them in the shops and I knew that they were horribly expensive. My mouth had often watered at the sight of them. \"Madame wants to know if you have any of those giant asparagus,\" I asked the waiter.\n\nI hoped he would say no. A happy smile spread over his broad face, and he assured me that they had some so large, so splendid, so tender, that it was a marvel.\n\n\"I\'m not in the least hungry,\" my guest sighed, \"but if you insist I don\'t mind having some asparagus.\n\nI ordered them.\n\n\"Aren\'t you going to have any?\"\n\n\"No, I never eat asparagus.\"\n\n\"I know there are people who don\'t like them.\"\n\nWe waited for the asparagus to be cooked. Panic seized me. It was not a question now how much money I should have left for the rest of the month, but whether I had enough to pay the bill. It would be terrible to find myself ten francs short and be obliged to borrow from my guest. I could not bring myself to do that. I knew exactly how much money I had and if the bill came to more I made up my mind that I would put my hand in my pocket and with a dramatic cry start up and say my money had been stolen. If she had not money enough to pay the bill then the only thing to do would be to leave my watch and say I would come back and pay later.\n\nThe asparagus appeared. They were enormous and appetizing. The smell of the melted butter tickled my nostrils. I watched the woman send them down her throat and in my polite way I talked on the condition of the drama in the Balkans. At last she finished.\n\n\"Coffee?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee,\" she answered.\n\nIt was all the same to me now, so I ordered coffee for myself and an ice-cream and coffee for her.\n\n\"You know, there\'s one thing I thoroughly believe in,\" she said, as she ate the ice-cream. \"One should always get up from a meal feeling one could eat a little more.\"\n\n\"Are you still hungry?\" I asked faintly.\n\n\"Oh, no, I\'m not hungry; you see, I don\'t eat luncheon. I have a cup of coffee in the morning and then dinner, but I never eat more than one thing for luncheon. I was speaking for you.\"\n\n\"Oh, I see!\"\n\nThen a terrible thing happened. While we were waiting for the coffee, the head waiter, with a smile on his false face, came up to us bearing a large basket full of huge peaches. Peaches were not in season then. Lord knew what they cost. I knew too — a little later, for my guest, going on with her conversation, absent-mindedly took one. \"You see, you\'ve filled your stomach with a lot of meat and you can\'t eat any more. But I\'ve just had a snack and I shall enjoy a peach.\"\n\nThe bill came and when I paid it I found that I had only enough for a quite inadequate tip. Her eyes rested for a moment on the three francs I left for the waiter and I knew that she thought me mean. But when I walked out of the restaurant I had the whole month before me and not a penny in my pocket.\n\n\"Follow my example,\" she said as we shook hands, \"and never eat more than one thing for luncheon.\"\n\n\"I\'ll do better than that,\" I answered. \"I\'ll eat nothing for dinner tonight.\"\n\n\"Humorist!\" she cried gaily, jumping into a cab. \"You\'re quite a humorist!\"\n\nBut I have had my revenge at last.

You didn\'t tell me that.\'\n\n\'I didn\'t think of it,\' said Miss Griffith. \'He never seemed to me really ill - just unlike himself. Once or twice I thought he had been drinking... For most of the time I\'ve been here he was always very secretive about his business affairs, but recently he\'d been talking openly about them, and spending large amounts of money - which wasn\'t like him. It seemed like he was looking forward to something exciting. And some very strange-looking people came to see him on business. It worried Mr Percival. Mr Fortescue was doing a lot of things that Mr Percival thought were unwise. But suddenly his father didn\'t listen to him any more and Mr Percival was very upset.\'\n\n\'And they had a real fight about it all?\' Inspector Neele asked. \'I don\'t know about a fight, but once, Mr Fortescue came into the typists\' room with Mr Percival and he called him names and swore at him. He said Mr Percival was too scared to expand the business in a big way. He said, \"I shall bring Lance home again. He\'s worth ten of you - and he married well. Lance is fearless and brave, even if he did risk a criminal prosecution once.\" Oh dear,\n\nI wish I hadn\'t said that!\'\n\n\'Don\'t worry,\' said Inspector Neele comfortingly. \'What\'s past is past. Tell me a little more about the staff here.\'\n\nInspector Neele was looking at the outside of Yewtree Lodge, a large, solid, red-brick building. The gardens were laid out in rose beds and ponds, with large numbers of neat yew hedges - and there was a huge yew tree, clearly very old. And possibly the poisonous berries from that very tree...? Inspector Neele rang the bell. The door was opened by a nervous-looking middle-aged man who invited Neele and Sergeant Hay in.\n\n\'Has Mrs Adele Fortescue returned yet?\'\n\n\'No, Sir.\'\n\n\'Nor Miss Elaine Fortescue?\'\n\n\'No, Sir.\'\n\n\'Then I would like to see Miss Dove, please.\'\n\nThe man turned his head slightly. \'Here\'s Miss Dove now - coming down the stairs.\'\n\nThe word housekeeper had given Neele an impression of someone large and powerful, dressed in black, and so the Inspector was quite unprepared for the small neat figure coming towards him. The light brown colour of her dress with its white collar and cuffs, the neat waves of hair and the slight smile, all seemed a little unreal, as though this young woman of under thirty was playing a part; not, Neele thought, the part of a housekeeper, but the part of Mary Dove, gentle and quiet like the bird, the dove, that shared her surname.\n\n\'Inspector Neele?\'\n\n\'Yes. This is Sergeant Hay. It seems likely that Mr Fortescue\'s death was caused by something he ate at breakfast this morning.\n\nI would like Sergeant Hay to be taken to the kitchen, where he can ask about the food that was served.\'\n\nHer eyes met his for a moment, thoughtfully, then she said, \'Of course.\' She turned to the butler, who was standing nervously nearby. \'Crump, will you take Sergeant Hay?\'\n\nThe two men left. Mary Dove said to Neele, \'Will you come in here?\' She opened the door of a sitting room and led him into it. \'Please sit down.\'\n\nMary Dove sat opposite him. She chose, he noticed, to face the light. An unusual choice for a woman. Still more unusual if a woman had anything to hide. But perhaps Mary Dove had nothing to hide.\n\n\'Mrs Adele Fortescue may return at any minute. And so may Mrs Jennifer. I have sent telegrams to Mr Percival Fortescue at various places.\'\n\n\'Thank you, Miss Dove.\'\n\n\'You say that Mr Fortescue\'s death was caused by something he may have eaten for breakfast? It seems unlikely. For breakfast this morning there was bacon and eggs, coffee, toast and marmalade. There was a cold ham, too, but that was also eaten yesterday, and no one was ill. No fish of any kind was served. For dinner last night...\'\n\n\'No.\' Inspector Neele interrupted her. \'We are not interested in dinner last night. Will you tell me exactly what Mr Fortescue ate and drank this morning?\'\n\n\'He had early tea brought to his room at eight o\'clock. Breakfast was at a quarter past nine. Mr Fortescue had eggs, bacon, coffee, toast and marmalade.\'\n\n\'Any cereal?\'\n\n\'No, he didn\'t like cereal.\'\n\n\'The sugar for the coffee...\'\n\n\'Mr Fortescue did not take sugar in his coffee,\' Miss Dove interrupted.\n\n\'Did he take any medicines in the morning?\'\n\n\'No, nothing like that.\'\n\n\'Who was at breakfast?\'\n\n\'Mrs Adele, Miss Elaine and Mrs Jennifer. Mrs Adele has only coffee, orange juice and toast, Mrs Jennifer and Miss Elaine always eat a large breakfast. As well as eating eggs and cold ham, they would probably have cereal as well. Mrs Jennifer drinks tea, not coffee.\'\n\nThree people had had breakfast with the deceased. Any of them might have had the opportunity to put taxine in Fortescue\'s cup of coffee. The bitterness of the coffee would have hidden the bitter taste of the Taxine... Neele looked up to find Mary Dove watching him.\n\n\'Your questions about medicines seem to me rather strange, Inspector,\' she said. \'It seems to suggest that either there was something wrong with a medicine, or that something had been put into it.\'\n\nNeele looked at her seriously. \'I did not say that Mr Fortescue died of food poisoning. But some kind of poisoning. In fact - just poisoning.\'\n\nShe repeated quietly, \'Poisoning...\' She appeared neither surprised nor anxious, simply interested. She said, \'I have never been involved with a poisoning case before.\'\n\n\'It\'s not very pleasant,\' Neele told her.\n\n\'No - I suppose not...\' She looked up at him with a sudden smile. \'I didn\'t do it,\' she said. \'But I suppose everybody says that!\'\n\n\'Have you any idea who did do it, Miss Dove?\'\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \'He was a horrible man. Anybody might have done it.\'\n\n\'Miss Dove, tell me something about the household here.\'\n\nShe looked up at him. He was a little surprised to see she looked amused.\n\n\'I don\'t want what I am going to say to be repeated at the inquest, but I would like to say it - unofficially.\'\n\n\'I\'m listening, Miss Dove.\'\n\nShe leaned back. \'Let me start by saying that I\'ve no feeling of loyalty to my employers. I work for them because it\'s a job that pays well and I insist that it pays well.\'\n\nNeele said, \'I was a little surprised to find you doing this type of job. With your obvious intelligence...\'\n\n\'I ought to be working in an office?\' interrupted Mary Dove. \'My dear Inspector Neele, some people will pay anything - anything - to avoid household worries. Firstly, finding and employing staff is very boring. Secondly, running the house properly requires abilities that most of the people I work for don\'t have.\'\n\n\'And what happens if your staff leave you unexpectedly? I\'ve heard of such things.\'\n\nMary smiled. \'If necessary, I can make the beds, clean the rooms, cook a meal and serve it, without anyone noticing the difference. But I work only for the extremely rich, who will pay anything to be comfortable. I pay top prices and so I get the best people available.\'\n\n\'Such as the butler?\' Neele asked, remembering the nervous Crump, whose red nose said he clearly liked alcohol too much.\n\nShe was amused. \'Crump stays because of Mrs Crump, who is one of the best cooks I\'ve ever worked with. As for Crump, he\'s not such a bad butler, really. I keep the key of the wine cellar and I watch the whisky and gin carefully. But you wanted to know what I think of the family. They are all really horrible. The late Mr Fortescue was the type of businessman who is always careful to work just on the right side of the law. He was rude and a bully. Mrs Fortescue, Adele - is about thirty years younger than he was - with real sex appeal, if you know what I mean.\'\n\nInspector Neele was shocked. A girl like Mary Dove ought not to say such things, he felt.\n\nThe young lady was continuing, Adele married him for his money, and Percival and Elaine are as nasty as they can be to her, but she doesn\'t care. Rex Fortescue would do anything for her. Oh dear, the wrong tense. I haven\'t really understood yet that he\'s dead...\'\n\n\'Let\'s hear about Percival Fortescue.\'\n\n\'Percival is a sly man. He\'s terrified of his father and has always let himself be bullied.\'\n\n\'And his wife?\'\n\n\'Jennifer is quiet and seems very stupid. But she was a hospital nurse before her marriage - she nursed Percival when he had pneumonia and then he married her. Rex Fortescue disliked poor Jennifer. She dislikes - disliked him a lot, I think. Her main interests are shopping and the cinema; her main complaint is that her husband, Percival, doesn\'t give her enough money.\'\n\n\'What about the daughter?\'\n\n\'Elaine? She\'s one of those schoolgirls who never grow up. There was some sort of romance with a young schoolmaster, Gerald Wright, but Mr Fortescue discovered the young man had communist ideas and made them end the relationship.\'\n\n\'She hadn\'t got the courage to stand up to him?\'\n\n\'She had. It was the young man who went away. I don\'t think he liked the idea that if she had married him, her father would have stopped giving her money to live on. Elaine is not particularly attractive.\'\n\n\'And the other son?\'\n\n\'I\'ve never seen Mr Lance. He\'s attractive, everyone says, but a bad boy. He forged a cheque in the past. He lives in East Africa. Mr Fortescue couldn\'t throw him out of the business completely because he\'d already made him a junior partner, but he hadn\'t kept in touch with him for years. All the same, I wouldn\'t be surprised if old Fortescue had been planning to get him back here. About a month ago, he discovered something that his eldest son, Percival, had been doing behind his back - I don\'t know what it was - and he was furious.\'\n\n\'Now, what about the servants? You\'ve described the Crumps. Who else is there?\'\n\n\'Gladys Martin is the parlour maid. She cleans the downstairs rooms, lays the table, clears away and helps Crump wait at table. Quite a respectable sort of girl, but very stupid. Ellen Curtis is elderly and bad-tempered, but an excellent housemaid.\'\n\n\'And those are the only people living here?\'\n\n\'There\'s old Miss Ramsbottom, Mr Fortescue\'s first wife\'s sister, who is well over seventy. She has a room on the second floor and never comes downstairs. She never liked her brother- in-law, but she came here while her sister was alive and stayed on when she died. Mr Fortescue isn\'t very interested in her. She\'s quite a character, though, is Miss Ramsbottom - or Aunt Effie as everyone calls her.\'\n\n\'So we come to you, Miss Dove.\'\n\n\'I\'m an orphan. I took a secretarial course and then a job as a shorthand typist. I decided I was in the wrong business, and started on my present career. I have been with three different employers. After about eighteen months I get tired of a place and move on. I have been at Yewtree Lodge for just over a year. I will type out the names and addresses of my previous employers and give them, with a copy of my references, to Sergeant Hay.\'\n\nNeele was silent for a moment, enjoying a mental image of Miss Dove collecting yew berries in a little basket. With a sigh he returned to the present. \'Now, I would like to see Gladys Martin and then Ellen Curtis.\' He added as he stood up, \'By the way, Miss Dove, can you give me any idea why Mr Fortescue would be carrying loose grain - rye, in fact - in his pocket?\'\n\n\'Grain?\' She stared at him.\n\n\'Yes - grain. Does that mean anything to you, Miss Dove?\'\n\n\'Nothing at all.\'\n\n\'Who looked after his clothes?\'\n\n\'Crump.\'\n\n\'I see. Did Mr Fortescue and Mrs Fortescue share the same bedroom?\'\n\n\'Yes. He had a dressing room and bathroom, of course, and so did she...\' Mary looked down at her wristwatch. \'I really think that she ought to be back very soon now.\'\n\nThe Inspector said in a pleasant voice, \'It seems to me very strange that even though there are three golf courses in the neighbourhood, it has not been possible to find Mrs Fortescue on one of them. Who was she playing with?\'\n\n\'I think it is possible that it might be Mr Vivian Dubois.\'\n\n\'I see.\'\n\n\'I\'ll send Gladys in to you. She\'ll probably be scared to death.\' Mary Dove went out. Inspector Neele looked at the closed door. What she had told him was very useful. If Rex Fortescue had been deliberately poisoned, and it seemed almost certain that he had, then there appeared to be plenty of motives at Yewtree Lodge.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30838, 11701),
(30841, '\nA Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie \n\nPart 3 \n\nThe girl who entered the room looked a bit dirty in spite of being tall and smartly dressed in a dark red uniform. She said at once, anxiously, \'I didn\'t do anything. I didn\'t really. I don\'t know anything about it.\'\n\n\'That\'s all right, Gladys,\' said Neele in a comforting voice. \'Sit down here. I just want to know about breakfast this morning.\'\n\nHe learnt little from her that he did not know already. Neele questioned her about herself and discovered that she had been in a private house first and after that had worked in various cafes. She had come to Yewtree Lodge in September. She had been there two months.\n\n\'Tell me about Mr Fortescue\'s clothes - his suits. Who took care of them?\'\n\nGladys looked slightly annoyed. \'Mr Crump\'s supposed to. But half the time he makes me do it.\'\n\n\'Have you ever found grain in the pocket of one of his suits? Rye, to be exact. There was some in the pocket of your master\'s jacket. Do you know how it got there?\'\n\n\'I couldn\'t say. I never saw any.\'\n\nHe could get no more information from her. She certainly seemed uneasy - but that was probably a natural fear of the police.\n\nInspector Neele went down to the kitchen where a very fat woman stepped towards him in a threatening way. \'Police!\' she said. \'Any food that I\'ve sent into the dining room has been just what it should be. How dare you come here and say that I poisoned the master! No bad food has ever been served in this house.\'\n\nIt was some time before Neele could reassure Mrs Crump that no one was accusing her of poisoning Rex Fortescue, then their conversation was ended by the ringing of the telephone.\n\nNeele went out into the hall to find Mary Dove taking the call. She was writing down a message on a notepad. Turning her head she said, \'It\'s a telegram. The post office can\'t send anyone so they called instead...\'\n\nShe handed the notepad to the Inspector. The telegram had come from Paris and the message, addressed to Rex Fortescue, said:\n\nI\'m sorry but your letter to me was delayed. We will be with you tomorrow about teatime. I will expect roast beef for dinner. Lance.\n\n\'So the Bad Boy son had been asked to come home,\' Inspector Neele said.\n\n \n\nInspector Neele was still holding the message when he heard a car drive up. Mary Dove said, \'That will be Mrs Fortescue now.\' As Inspector Neele moved forwards to the front door, he saw Mary Dove disappear.\n\nThe car was a Rolls Bentley sports model. Two people came towards the house as Neele opened the front door. Surprised, Adele Fortescue stared at Inspector Neele, who realized at once that Adele Fortescue spoke and moved and breathed sex appeal. He then looked at the man behind her, who was carrying her golf clubs. He knew the type very well. They made their living from the young wives of rich elderly men.\n\n\'Mrs Fortescue? I am Inspector Neele. I\'m afraid I have bad news for you. Your husband became seriously ill this morning. We\'ve been trying to contact you since half-past eleven. He was taken to St Jude\'s and I\'m afraid you must prepare yourself for a shock.\'\n\n\'You don\'t mean - he\'s - dead.\' She fell forward a little and held onto his arm and the Inspector took her into the hall. Crump was there. \'She\'ll be needing brandy,\' he said.\n\nThe deep voice of Mr Dubois said, \'That\'s right, Crump. Get the brandy.\' To the Inspector he said, \'In here.\' He opened the sitting room door and Adele Fortescue sat down on a chair, her eyes covered with her hand. She accepted the glass that the Inspector offered a minute later and drank a tiny amount, then pushed it away. \'I don\'t want it. Tell me, what was it? A stroke. I suppose? Poor Rex.\'\n\n\'It wasn\'t a stroke. I\'m afraid we need to find out as soon as possible exactly what Mr Fortescue had to eat or drink before he left for the office this morning.\'\n\n\'Do you mean he might have been poisoned? I can\'t believe it. Oh - you mean food poisoning.\'\n\nHis face showing nothing, Inspector Neele said, \'Madam? What did you think I meant?\'\n\nShe ignored that question as Dubois said, looking at his watch, \'I must go, Adele. I\'m very, very sorry. You\'ll be all right, won\'t you?\'\n\n\'Oh, Vivian, don\'t. Don\'t go!\' Adele Fortescue said.\n\n\'I\'m really sorry but I\'ve got an important meeting. I\'m staying at the Golf Hotel, by the way, Inspector. If you - er - want me for anything.\'\n\nInspector Neele nodded. Mr Dubois was clearly running away from trouble! Adele Fortescue said, \'I expect it\'s the awful bacon we get. It\'s quite uneatable sometimes.\'\n\n\'We shall find out, Mrs Fortescue. You\'ve got a lot of yew trees round the house. Is it possible that some of the berries or leaves got mixed up in any food or drink?\'\n\nAdele put her hands to her head. \'I don\'t want to talk about it! I can\'t stand any more. Mr Percival Fortescue will arrange everything. I can\'t... I can\'t... it isn\'t fair to ask me.\'\n\n\'There\'s just one thing, Mrs Fortescue. There was a small amount of grain in your husband\'s pocket. Could you give me some explanation of that?\'\n\nShe shook her head, puzzled.\n\nWould anyone have put it in there as a joke?\'\n\n\'I don\'t see why it would be a joke.\' She pulled out a handkerchief. \'It\'s so awful,\' she said. \'Poor Rex. Poor dear Rex.\' She began to cry as Inspector Neele watched her.\n\n\'It\'s been very sudden, I know,\' he said. \'I\'ll send someone in to you.\' He went towards the door and paused for a moment before looking back.\n\nAdele Fortescue still held the handkerchief to her eyes. The ends of it hung down but did not quite hide her mouth. On her lips was a very small smile.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30840, 11701),
(30843, '\nA Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie \n\n    Part 4 \n\n\'I\'ve got what I could, Sir,\' Sergeant Hay reported. \'The marmalade, a piece of the ham and samples of tea, coffee and sugar. What they actually drank has been thrown away, of course, but there was a lot of coffee left over and the staff had it in the servants\' hall.\'\n\n\'So if the poison was in the coffee Fortescue drank, it must have been put into the actual cup by someone at the table,\' said Neele.\n\nThe telephone rang and Neele nodded to Sergeant Hay, who went to answer it. It was Scotland Yard. They had finally contacted Percival Fortescue, who was returning to London immediately. As the Inspector replaced the telephone receiver, a woman arrived at the front door, her arms full of parcels. Crump took them from her.\n\n\'Thanks, Crump. I\'ll have tea now. Is Mrs Fortescue or Miss Elaine in?\'\n\nThe butler hesitated. \'We\'ve had bad news, ma\'am,\' he said. \'About the master.\'\n\nNeele came forward as she said, \'What\'s happened? An accident?\' Mrs Jennifer Fortescue was a slightly overweight woman of about thirty. Her questions came with obvious interest.\n\n\'I\'m sorry to tell you that Mr Rex Fortescue was taken to St Jude\'s Hospital. He was seriously ill and has since died,\' Neele said quietly.\n\n\'Died?\' The news was clearly more exciting than sad. \'Dear me - are you from the office? You\'re not a doctor, are you?\'\n\n\'I\'m a police officer. Mr Fortescue\'s death was very sudden and...\'\n\nShe interrupted him. \'Do you mean he was murdered?\' It was the first time that word had been spoken.\n\n\'Now why should you think that, Madam?\'\n\n\'Well, you said sudden. And you\'re police. Have you seen her about it? What did she say?\'\n\n\'Who are you talking about?\'\n\n\'Adele, of course. He was completely under that awful woman\'s spell - and now look what\'s happened... What was it? Arsenic?\'\n\n\'The cause of death has not been decided yet. There will be an autopsy and an inquest.\'\n\n\'But you know already, don\'t you? Or you wouldn\'t have come down here.\' There was a sudden look of understanding in her rather silly face. \'You\'ve been asking about what he ate and drank, I suppose?\'\n\nNeele said, \'It seems possible that Mr Fortescue\'s illness was caused by something he ate at breakfast.\'\n\n\'Breakfast? I don\'t see how she could have done it, then... unless she put something into the coffee - when Elaine and I weren\'t looking...\'\n\nA quiet voice spoke softly, \'Your tea is in the library, Mrs Jennifer.\'\n\nJennifer Fortescue jumped. \'Oh thank you, Miss Dove. What about you, Mr - Inspector...\'\n\n\'Thank you, no tea just now.\'\n\nJennifer went slowly away as Mary Dove said quietly, \'I don\'t think she\'s ever heard of the word slander. Is there anything I can do for you, Inspector Neele?\'\n\n\'Where can I find the housemaid, Ellen?\'\n\n***\n\nEllen was as bad-tempered as Mary Dove had said she was, but she was also unafraid. \'It\'s a shocking business. Sir. And I never thought I\'d find myself in a house where such an awful thing has happened. But I can\'t say that it surprises me. Of course, I don\'t approve of what\'s been going on here. All this pretending to play golf - or tennis - and the library door was open one day and there they were, kissing.\'\n\nNeele really felt it unnecessary to say, \'Whom do you mean?\' but he said it anyway.\n\n\'I mean Mrs Adele - and that man Dubois. You\'ve been asking questions, Sir, about what the master ate and drank and who gave it to him. That Dubois found some kind of poison somewhere and she gave it to the master, I\'ve no doubt.\'\n\n\'Have you ever seen any yew berries in the house?\'\n\n\'Yew? Nasty poisonous stuff. Don\'t you even touch yew berries, my mother said to me when I was a child. Was that what was used, Sir? Well, I\'ve never seen her with yew berries.\' Ellen sounded disappointed.\n\nNeele questioned her about the grain found in Fortescue\'s pocket.\n\n\'No, Sir. I know nothing about that.\'\n\nFinally he asked if he could see Miss Ramsbottom, and Ellen took him upstairs. She knocked on a door, then opened it and said, \'There\'s a policeman here, an Inspector, who would like to speak to you, Miss.\'\n\nThe room he entered was full of furniture and an old lady was sitting at a table in front of a gas fire, laying out cards in a game of patience. Without looking up, she said impatiently, \'Well, come in, come in. What is it?\'\n\n\'I\'m sorry to tell you, Miss Ramsbottom, that your brother- in-law, Mr Fortescue, became ill and died this morning. I hope it\'s not a shock to you?\'\n\nMiss Ramsbottom looked at him sharply and said, \'Not at all. Rex Fortescue was always a sinful man and I never liked him.\'\n\n\'It seems possible that he may have been poisoned...\'\n\n\'Well, I didn\'t poison him, if that\'s what you want to know.\'\n\n\'Have you any idea who might have done so?\'\n\n\'Two of my dead sister\'s children are living in this house,\' said the old lady. \'I refuse to believe that anybody with Ramsbottom blood in them could be guilty of murder. Because it is murder, isn\'t it? Plenty of people have wanted to murder Rex. He is - was - a very crooked man.\'\n\n\'And is there anyone in particular you believe might have wanted to murder Mr Fortescue?\'\n\nMiss Ramsbottom collected her cards and rose to her feet. \'I think you\'d better go now,\' she said. \'If you want my opinion, it was probably one of the servants. Good evening.\'\n\nInspector Neele found himself walking out without argument. He came down the stairs and came face to face with a tall, dark girl wearing a damp raincoat.\n\n\'I\'ve just come back,\' she said. \'And they told me - that Father\'s dead.\'\n\n\'I\'m afraid that\'s true.\'\n\nSlowly two tears ran down her cheeks. \'It\'s awful,\' Elaine Fortescue said. \'Do you know, I didn\'t think that I even liked him... I thought I hated him... But that can\'t be so, or I wouldn\'t be upset. And I am upset. The awful thing is that it makes everything alright. I mean, Gerald - my boyfriend - and I can get married now. But I hate it happening this way. I don\'t want Father to be dead... Oh Daddy - Daddy...\'\n\nFor the first time since he had come to Yewtree Lodge, Inspector Neele was surprised by what seemed to be real grief for the dead man.\n\n***\n\nBack at Scotland Yard, the Assistant Commissioner had been listening to Neele giving his report. \'It sounds to me as if the wife murdered him,\' said the Assistant Commissioner. \'What do you think, Neele, eh?\'\n\nInspector Neele said that it looked like the wife to him, too. \'What about the other people in the house who had the opportunity?\' asked the Assistant Commissioner.\n\n\'The daughter, Elaine, was involved with a young man, Gerald Wright, but her father didn\'t want her to marry him. And he definitely wasn\'t going to marry her unless she had money. That gives her a motive. As to the daughter-in-law, Jennifer, I don\'t know enough about her yet. But any one of the three of them could have poisoned him. The parlour maid, the butler and the cook all handled the breakfast or brought it in, but I don\'t see how any of them could have been sure that Fortescue would get the Taxine and nobody else. The butler and the parlour maid both seem nervous, but there\'s nothing unusual about that with servants. The cook\'s angry and the housemaid was pleased. In fact, all quite natural and normal.\'\n\n\'Is there anybody else who might be suspicious in some way?\'\n\n\'No, I don\'t think so, Sir.\' Inspector Neele\'s mind went to Mary Dove, but aloud he said, \'Now that analysis has shown that it\'s definitely Taxine, it should be possible to find some evidence as to how it was prepared.\'\n\n\'Well, go ahead, Neele. By the way, Mr Percival Fortescue is waiting to see you. We\'ve found the other son, Lance, too. He\'s in Paris, leaving today. You\'ll arrange for someone to meet him at the airport, won\'t you?\'\n\n\'Yes, Sir.\'\n\n***\n\nMr Percival Fortescue was a neat, fair man of about thirty, with pale hair and eyelashes. \'This has been a terrible shock to me, Inspector Neele, as you can well imagine. I can only say that my father was perfectly well when I left. This food poisoning must have been very sudden?\'\n\n\'It was very sudden, yes. But it wasn\'t food poisoning. Your father was poisoned by Taxine.\'\n\n\'Taxine? I\'ve never heard of it.\'\n\n\'Very few people have. It is a most unpleasant poison.\'\n\n\'That\'s terrible!\'\n\n\'Yes indeed, Mr Fortescue.\'\n\n\'May I ask, do you have any ideas, any suspicions of who could... Really, I...\' He broke off.\n\n\'It\'s rather soon for that, Mr Fortescue. It would be helpful if you could give us some idea of your father\'s will.\'\n\n\'My father made a new will when he got married two years ago,\' said Percival. \'He left 100,000 pounds to his wife and 50,000 pounds to my sister, Elaine. I inherit everything else. I am already, of course, a partner in the firm.\'\n\n\'There was no bequest to your brother, Lance?\'\n\n\'No, my father had refused to have any contact with my brother for a long time.\'\n\n\'So,\' said Inspector Neele, \'the three people who inherit your father\'s fortune are Mrs Adele Fortescue, Miss Elaine Fortescue and yourself?\'\n\n\'I don\'t think there will be much of a fortune.\' Percival sighed. \'There are death duties, and lately my father had been behaving recklessly in some of his financial dealings.\'\n\n\'You say your father and brother were not in touch with one another? Then perhaps you can tell me what this means?\' Neele gave him the telephone message Mary Dove had written down.\n\nPercival was surprised and annoyed. \'I can\'t understand it, I really can\'t. I can hardly believe it.\'\n\n\'Your father said nothing to you about it?\'\n\n\'He certainly did not. How outrageous of him. To go behind my back and send for Lance.\'\n\n\'You\'ve no idea, I suppose, why he did such a thing?\'\n\n\'Of course I haven\'t. It\'s exactly like all his behaviour lately - crazy! It\'s got to be stopped. I...\' Percival came to a stop. The colour went from his already pale face. \'I had forgotten... for a moment I had forgotten that my father was dead...\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 30842, 11701);

He stared at Detective Inspector Neele, who had met him and his wife at the airport and had taken them into a small office. Neele said, \'You\'ve no idea then at all, who might have poisoned your father?\'\n\n\'No. I expect the old man made a lot of enemies in business. But poisoning? Anyway, I\'ve been abroad for years and know very little of what was going on at home.\'\n\n\'Would you like to tell me why you came home at this time?\'\n\n\'Certainly, Inspector. I heard from my father six months ago, soon after my marriage. He suggested that I came home and enter the firm. I came over to England three months ago and went down to see him at Yewtree Lodge. He made me a very good offer and I flew back to East Africa to discuss it with my wife, Pat. And I decided to accept the offer. I had to finish up my business there, and I told him I would send him a telegram with the date of my arrival in England.\'\n\nInspector Neele coughed. \'This seems to have caused your brother some surprise.\'\n\nLance\'s attractive face lit up with laughter. \'I believe Percival knew nothing about it,\' he said. \'He was on holiday in Norway when I came over and I suspect that my father made his offer to me because he had had a huge fight with poor Percival. It would be just the old man\'s idea of a good joke to bring me home. However, as usual, Percy wins. I\'ve arrived too late.\'\n\n\'Yes,\' said Inspector Neele thoughtfully. \'On your visit last August, did you meet any other members of the family?\'\n\n\'My stepmother was there at tea.\' He grinned. \'The old boy certainly knew how to choose a woman.\'\n\n\'Were you upset about your father\'s remarriage?\'\n\n\'I certainly wasn\'t. What I\'m really surprised at, is that the old man didn\'t marry again before. Is that how it is, Inspector? Do you suspect my stepmother of poisoning my father?\'\n\nInspector Neele\'s face became blank. \'It\'s early days to have any definite ideas about anything, Mr Fortescue,\' he said pleasantly. \'Now, may I ask you what your plans are?\'\n\n\'Where is the family? All down at Yewtree Lodge?\'\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\n\'I should go down there straight away.\' He turned to his wife. \'And you should go and stay at the Barnes\'s Hotel, Pat. I\'m not sure of my welcome - and I don\'t want to take you to a house where there\'s a poisoner around.\'\n\n \n\nVivian Dubois tore up Adele Fortescue\'s letter angrily. Adele had telephoned him three times, and now she had written. On the whole, writing was far worse. He went to the telephone. \'Can I speak to Mrs Adele Fortescue, please?\' A minute or two later he heard her voice.\n\n***\n\n\'Vivian, at last! Oh, darling, the police have finally gone!\'\n\n\'Yes, yes, but look here, Adele, we\'ve got to be careful. Don\'t telephone me and don\'t write. Just for now, you understand? We must be careful. And Adele, my letters to you. You did burn them, didn\'t you?\' There was a moment\'s hesitation before Adele Fortescue said, \'Of course.\'\n\n\'That\'s all right then. You\'ll hear from me soon.\' He didn\'t like that hesitation. His letters were innocent enough, he thought, but he could not be sure. Even if Adele had not already burnt his letters, would she have the sense to burn them now? Where did she keep them? Probably in that sitting room of hers upstairs in that fake antique desk. She had said there was a secret drawer in it. Secret drawer! That wouldn\'t fool the police for long. But there were no police at the house now. They were probably busy looking for how Rex Fortescue was poisoned. They would not have done a room-by-room search of the house. It was possible that if he acted at once...\n\n***\n\nMary Dove paused at the window on the stairs, and in the late afternoon light outside noticed a man disappearing behind some bushes. Was it Lance Fortescue, walking round the garden before coming in to face a possibly unfriendly family? In the hall she saw Gladys, who jumped in surprise when she saw her.\n\n\'Was that the telephone I heard just now?\' Mary asked.\n\n\'Oh, that was a wrong number.\' Gladys sounded breathless. \'And before that, it was Mr Dubois. He wanted to speak to the mistress.\'\n\nMary said, \'Haven\'t you taken the tea in yet? It\'s twenty minutes to five. Bring it in now, will you?\' Mary Dove went into the library and Gladys went to the kitchen, where Mrs Crump was making a pie. \'The library bell\'s been ringing and ringing. It\'s time you took in the tea, my girl.\'\n\n\'All right, all right, Mrs Crump.\'\n\nGladys went into the pantry. She wasn\'t going to make sandwiches. They had cakes and biscuits and scones and honey. She had other things to think about. She made the tea in the silver pot, then carried the tea things on the big silver tray through to the library. She went back for the other tray with the food on it and had carried it as far as the hall, when the sudden ringing of the clock in the hall at five o\'clock made her jump.\n\nIn the library, Adele Fortescue said sharply to Mary Dove, \'Where is everybody?\'\n\n\'I really don\'t know, Mrs Fortescue. Miss Elaine came in some time ago and I think Mrs Jennifer\'s writing letters in her room. I\'ll tell her that tea is ready.\'\n\nGoing towards the door, she stood aside as Elaine Fortescue came into the room, then stopped for a moment in the hall. A large tray with cakes and scones on it was on one of the hall tables and she thought she heard Jennifer Fortescue walking upstairs. Nobody, however, came down the stairs and Mary went up and along the corridor. She knocked on a door and Mrs Jennifer\'s voice said, \'Come in.\' Mary opened the door. \'Tea is just about to be served, Mrs Jennifer.\' She was rather surprised to see Jennifer\n\nFortescue taking off a warm coat. \'I didn\'t know you\'d been out,\' said Mary.\n\nJennifer sounded slightly out of breath. \'Oh, I was just in the garden, getting a little fresh air. But really, it was too cold.\' Jennifer Fortescue followed Mary out of the room.\n\nDownstairs in the hall, to Mary\'s surprise, the tray of food was still on the table. She was about to go and call Gladys when Adele Fortescue appeared in the door of the library, saying, \'Aren\'t we ever going to have anything to eat for tea?\'\n\nQuickly, Mary picked up the tray and took it in. She was carrying the empty tray out again when the front door bell rang. Mary went to the door. If this was Lance Fortescue at last, she was rather curious to see him.\n\n\'How unlike the rest of the Fortescues,\' Mary thought, as she looked up into the dark, handsome face. She said quietly, \'Mr Lance Fortescue?\'\n\n\'Himself.\'\n\nMary looked past him. \'Your luggage?\'\n\n\'I\'ve paid the taxi. This is all I\'ve got.\' He picked up a medium-sized bag.\n\n\'Oh, I thought you walked up. And your wife?\'\n\n\'My wife won\'t be coming. At least, not just yet.\'\n\n\'I see. Come this way, Mr Fortescue. Everyone is having tea.\' She took him to the library door and left him there. She thought to herself that Lance Fortescue was a very attractive man. A second thought followed the first, probably a great many other women thought so, too.\n\n***\n\n\'Lance!\' Elaine threw her arms round his neck with delight. He took them away gently and looked around the room.\n\n\'This is Jennifer?\'\n\nJennifer Fortescue looked at him with curiosity. \'I\'m afraid Percival\'s been delayed in town,\' she said. \'He has to organize everything. You really have no idea what we\'re all feeling.\'\n\n\'It must be terrible for you,\' said Lance seriously, then he turned to the woman on the sofa, who was sitting with a piece of scone and honey in her hand.\n\n\'Of course,\' cried Jennifer, \'you don\'t know Adele, do you?\' Lance said quietly, \'Oh yes, I do,\' as he took Adele Fortescue\'s hand in his. As he looked down at her, her eyelids fluttered. She said in her lovely soft voice, \'Sit down here on the sofa beside me, Lance. I\'m so glad you\'ve come, we badly need another man in the house.\' Lance said, \'You must let me do everything I can to help.\'\n\n\'The police here. They think... they think...\' she broke off and cried out passionately. \'Oh, it\'s awful! He was poisoned, and I really do believe they think it was one of us.\'\n\nLance gave her a sudden quick smile. \'It\'s no good worrying,\' he said, and changing the subject, exclaimed, \'Oh what a wonderful chocolate cake. I must have some.\' Cutting himself a slice, he asked, \'Is Aunt Effie alive still?\'\n\n\'Oh, yes, Lance. She won\'t come down and have meals with us, but she\'s quite well. Only she\'s getting very strange,\' said Elaine.\n\n\'She always was strange,\' said Lance. \'I must go up and see her after tea. And who\'s the young lady with the soft voice and sweet face who let me in? What goes on behind it, I wouldn\'t like to say.\'\n\n\'That,\' said Jennifer, \'is Mary Dove. She looks after everything for us.\'\n\n\'Does she, now?\'\n\nAdele said, \'She\'s really very useful.\'\n\n\'But what is so nice,\' said Jennifer, \'is that she knows her place.\'\n\n\'Clever Mary Dove,\' said Lance, and took another piece of chocolate cake.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30844, 11701),
(30847, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie \n\nPart 6 \n\n\'So you\'ve turned up again!\' said Miss Ramsbottom.\n\nLance grinned at her. \'Just as you say, Aunt Effie.\'\n\nMiss Ramsbottom looked disapproving. \'Have you got your wife with you?\'\n\n\'No. I left Pat in London.\'\n\n\'That shows some sense. You never know what might happen here.\'\n\n\'To Pat?\'\n\n\'To anybody,\' said Miss Ramsbottom.\n\nLance Fortescue looked at her thoughtfully. \'What\'s been going on here? What gives the police the idea that Father was killed in this house?\'\n\n\'Adultery is one thing and murder is another,\' said Miss Ramsbottom. \'I would hate to think that she could kill someone.\'\n\nLance looked alert. \'Adele?\'\n\n\'I\'m not saying anything else,\' said Miss Ramsbottom, \'but I\'ll tell you one thing. I believe that girl knows something about it.\'\n\n\'Which girl?\'\n\n\'The one that never looks completely clean,\' said Miss Ramsbottom. \'The one that should have brought up my tea this afternoon, but didn\'t. She\'s gone out without permission, so Ellen told me. I wouldn\'t be surprised if she has gone to the police. Who let you in?\'\n\n\'Someone called Mary Dove. Is she the one who\'s gone to the police?\'\n\n\'Mary Dove wouldn\'t go to the police,\' said Miss Ramsbottom. \'No - I mean that silly little parlour maid. She\'s been looking frightened all day. \"What\'s the matter with you?\" I said to her.\n\n\"Have you got a guilty conscience?\" She said, \"I never did anything - I wouldn\'t do a thing like that.\" Then she began to cry and said she didn\'t want to get anybody into trouble, she was sure it must all be a mistake. I said to her, \"Now, my girl, you go to the police and tell them anything you know, because bad things happen when you hide the truth.\" Then she said she couldn\'t go to the police and said that anyway she didn\'t know anything at all.\'\n\n\'You don\'t think that she was just making herself important?\'\n\n\'No, I don\'t. She was scared. I think she saw something or heard something that\'s given her some idea about the whole thing. It may be important, or it may not.\'\n\n\'The whole thing seems so strange. Like a detective story,\' Lance said.\n\n\'Percival\'s wife used to be a hospital nurse,\' said Miss Ramsbottom. \'Hospital nurses are used to handling drugs.\' Lance looked doubtful.\n\n\'Family affection is one thing,\' said Miss Ramsbottom, \'and I hope I\'ve got as much of it as anyone. But I won\'t have wickedness. Wickedness has to be destroyed.\'\n\n***\n\n\'Gladys went out without a word to me,\' said Mrs Crump to Mary Dove. \'The master\'s dead, Mr Lance is coming home, and I said to Crump, \"Day off or no day off, I know my duty. There\'s not going to be cold supper tonight as is usual on a Thursday, but a proper dinner.\" You know me, Miss, you know I like to do good work.\'\n\nMary Dove nodded her head gently as Mrs Crump continued. \'And what did Crump say? \"It\'s my day off and I\'m going out,\" that\'s what he said. So out he went and I told Gladys she\'d have to manage alone tonight. She just said, \"All right, Mrs Crump,\" then she went out, without telling anyone.\'\n\n\'We shall manage, Mrs Crump,\' Mary\'s voice was comforting. \'I shall serve at table if Gladys doesn\'t come back in time.\'\n\n\'She won\'t come back,\' said Mrs Crump. \'She\'s got a young man, Miss, though you wouldn\'t think any man would be attracted to her with all those spots on her face! Albert his name is. They\'re going to get married next spring, so she tells me.\' She sighed. \'What about tea things, Miss. Who\'s going to clear them away and wash them up?\'\n\n\'I\'ll do that,\' said Mary.\n\nThe lights had not been turned on in the library, though Adele Fortescue was still sitting on the sofa behind the tea tray.\n\n\'Shall I switch the lights on, Mrs Fortescue?\' Mary asked.\n\nAdele did not answer. Mary switched on the lights and it was only when she turned her head, that she saw the half-eaten scone spread with honey beside Adele, and her teacup still half full. Death had come to Adele Fortescue suddenly.\n\n***\n\n\'Well?\' demanded Inspector Neele.\n\nThe doctor said, \'Cyanide - potassium cyanide probably - in the tea.\'\n\nNeele was angry. Poisoned! While he was in the house. Elaine had been the last to leave the library. According to her, Adele had been pouring herself a last cup of tea. And after that, it was twenty minutes until Mary Dove came into the room and discovered the body. Inspector Neele swore to himself and went out into the kitchen where Mrs Crump hardly moved as he came in. \'Where\'s that girl? Has she come back yet?\'\n\n\'Gladys? No.\'\n\n\'She made the tea, you say, and took it in.\'\n\n\'Inspector Neele, I don\'t believe Gladys would do a thing like that - not Gladys. She\'s a bit silly, that\'s all - not wicked.\'\n\nNo, Neele did not think that Gladys was wicked. And the cyanide had not been in the teapot. \'But what made her go out suddenly - it wasn\'t her day off, you say.\'\n\n\'No, Sir, tomorrow\'s her day off. But she had her best nylons on,\' said Mrs Crump. \'So she was going to do something that wasn\'t connected with her work. Oh yes, she was up to something. I\'ll give her a good telling-off when she comes back.\' When she comes back - Neele felt uneasy suddenly and couldn\'t think why. He went upstairs to Adele Fortescue\'s sitting room. He had searched it carefully the day before and found the secret drawer in the desk. Now he made a small exclamation. On the centre of the carpet was a small piece of mud. Neele went over and picked it up. It was still damp. He looked round - there were no footprints - only this one bit of mud.\n\n***\n\nInspector Neele looked round the bedroom that belonged to Gladys Martin. It was past eleven o\'clock but there was still no sign of Gladys. Ellen, the housemaid, whose help he had wanted, had not been helpful. She didn\'t know what clothes Gladys owned, so she couldn\'t say what, if anything, was missing. He turned to the drawers where Gladys kept her treasures. There were postcards and bits cut out of newspapers with hints on beauty, dressmaking and fashion advice.\n\nInspector Neele sorted them into groups. The postcards were mainly of views of places where he guessed Gladys had spent her holidays, but there were three from someone named \'Albert.\' The first postcard said - in uneducated handwriting:\n\nAll the best. Missing you a lot. Yours ever, Albert.\n\nThe second one said:\n\nLots of nice-looking girls here, but not one that\'s as lovely as you. Be seeing you soon. Don\'t forget our date. And remember after that - we\'ll be living happy ever after.\n\nThe third just said:\n\nDon\'t forget. I trust you. Love, B.\n\nNext, Neele looked through the pieces of newspaper and sorted them into three piles. There were the fashion and beauty hints, there were items about cinema stars, and she had also been interested in science. There were articles about secret weapons and about truth drugs used by Russians to make people confess to crimes. But there was nothing to give him a clue to her disappearance. She had kept no diary. Neele left the room, and as he went down the stairs he heard the noise of running feet. Then Sergeant Hay\'s worried face looked up at him from the bottom of the stairs.\n\n\'Sir,\' he said urgently. \'Sir! We\'ve found the parlour maid! The housemaid, Ellen, remembered that she hadn\'t brought the clothes in from the washing line. So she went out with a torch and she almost fell over the girl\'s body - strangled, she was, with a stocking round her throat - she\'s been dead for hours, I\'d say. And, Sir, it\'s a wicked kind of joke - there was a clothes peg on her nose...\'\n\n***\n\nTwo days later Crump opened the door and saw a tall, elderly lady wearing an old-fashioned tweed coat and skirt, a couple of scarves and a small hat with a bird\'s wing on it. An old but good-quality suitcase was by her feet. Crump recognized a lady when he saw one and said, \'Yes, Madam?\' in his most respectful voice.\n\n\'I have come,\' Miss Marple said, \'to speak about the poor girl who was killed. Gladys Martin. Could I see the mistress of the house, please?\'\n\n\'Oh, I see, Madam. Well in that case...\' he looked towards the library door from which a tall young woman had just come out. \'This is Mrs Patricia Fortescue, Madam. I\'m afraid Mr Percival\'s wife and Miss Elaine are out.\'\n\nPatricia came forward and Miss Marple was aware of a faint feeling of surprise. She had not expected to see someone like Patricia Fortescue in this luxuriously decorated house.\n\n\'It\'s about Gladys, Madam,\' said Crump helpfully.\n\nPat said rather hesitantly, \'Will you come in here? We shall be completely alone.\' She led the way into the library and Miss Marple followed her.\n\n\'My husband and I only came back from Africa a few days ago,\' said Pat, \'and I only came to Yewtree Lodge yesterday, so I don\'t really know anything much about the household.\'\n\nMiss Marple looked at the girl and liked her. At the gymkhanas held locally round her village, St Mary Mead, Miss Marple had met many Pats and knew them well. She felt comfortable with this rather unhappy-looking girl.\n\n\'It\'s very simple, really,\' said Miss Marple. \'I read in the paper, you see, about Gladys Martin having been killed. And of course I know all about her. I trained her, in fact, to be a parlour maid.\n\nAnd since this terrible thing has happened to her, I felt - well, I felt that I ought to come and see if there was anything I could do about it.\'\n\n\'Yes,\' said Pat. \'Of course. I see.\' And she did see at once just why Miss Marple needed to do something for a girl she had known so well. \'Nobody seems to know very much about her,\' said Pat. \'I mean her relations and all that.\'\n\n\'No,\' said Miss Marple, \'she had no relations. She came to me from the orphanage. St Faith\'s, and I taught her how to wait at table and look after the silverware. As soon as she got a little experience, she took a job in a cafe.\'\n\n\'I never saw her,\' said Pat. \'Was she a pretty girl?\'\n\n\'Oh, no,\' said Miss Marple. \'And she had bad skin. She was rather stupid, too. She was very interested in men, poor girl. But men didn\'t take much notice of her and other girls made use of her - got her to do things for them and were then unkind to her.\'\n\n\'It sounds rather cruel.\' said Pat.\n\n\'Yes, my dear,\' said Miss Marple, \'life is cruel, I\'m afraid. Girls like Gladys enjoy going to the cinema and all that, but they\'re always dreaming of impossible things that can\'t possibly happen to them and they get disappointed. It was the clothes peg that made me so very angry. It was such a cruel thing to do! It\'s very wicked, you know, to show such disrespect. Particularly if you\'ve already killed.\'\n\nPat said slowly, \'I believe I see what you mean. I think you should come and see Inspector Neele. He\'s a very human person.\' She gave a sudden shiver. \'The whole thing is such a horrible nightmare. Pointless. Mad. Without rhyme or reason to it.\'\n\n\'I wouldn\'t say that, you know,\' said Miss Marple. \'No, I wouldn\'t say that.\'\n\n***\n\nInspector Neele was looking extremely tired and worried. Adele Fortescue, his main suspect, was now the second victim in an unsolved murder case. But strangely, Inspector Neele had felt some satisfaction. The explanation that the wife and the lover had been responsible for Rex Fortescue\'s death had been too easy. He had always mistrusted it. And now that mistrust was confirmed. He looked with interest at the gentle, serious face of the old lady who sat with him now at Yewtree Lodge.\n\n\'It\'s very good of you to come here, Miss Marple,\' he said.\n\n\'It was my duty, Inspector Neele. The girl had lived in my house. I feel responsible for her. She was a very silly girl, you know.\' Inspector Neele looked at her with respect. She had gone, he felt, to the heart of the matter. \'When you say that she was silly...\'\n\n\'She was the sort of girl who would give all her money to any man who told her she was beautiful and he needed it - if she had any money. Of course, Gladys never did have any because she always spent it on most unsuitable clothes.\'\n\n\'What about men?\' asked the Inspector.\n\n\'She wanted a young man badly,\' said Miss Marple. \'And I understand she got herself one in the end?\'\n\nInspector Neele nodded. \'Albert Evans. She met him at some holiday camp. He was an engineer who worked in mines abroad, so she told the cook.\'\n\n\'That seems most unlikely,\' said Miss Marple, \'but I am sure that is what he told her. You don\'t connect him with this business at all?\'\n\nInspector Neele shook his head. \'No. He never seems to have visited her.\'\n\n\'Well,\' said Miss Marple, \'I\'m pleased she had her little romance. Since her life has been cut short in this way... I wonder - could I help you in my very small way? This is a wicked murderer, Inspector Neele, and the wicked should not go unpunished.\'\n\n\'That\'s an unfashionable belief nowadays, Miss Marple,\' Inspector Neele said. \'Not that I don\'t agree with you.\'\n\n\'There is a hotel near the station,\' said Miss Marple, \'and I believe there\'s a Miss Ramsbottom in this house who is interested in the work of foreign missions. As I am. You know, help for poor people in Africa and India and so on. I believe we could have a good conversation about that - and other things...\'\n\nInspector Neele looked at Miss Marple with respect. \'Yes, I think that would be a great help. I can\'t say that I\'ve had great success with the lady.\'\n\n\'It\'s really very kind of you, Inspector Neele,\' said Miss Marple. \'I\'m so happy you don\'t think I\'m just being a curious old woman.\'\n\nInspector Neele gave a sudden unexpected smile. Miss Marple seemed a very unlikely person to be helping him find a murderer. She continued speaking. \'Newspapers,\' she said, \'so often make their reports more exciting than they really are.\' She looked at Inspector Neele. \'Can you tell me the simple facts?\'\n\n\'Mr Fortescue died in his office,\' said Neele, \'as a result of Taxine poisoning. Taxine comes from the berries and leaves of yew trees.\'\n\n\'And Mrs Fortescue?\'\n\n\'Adele Fortescue had tea with the family in the library. The last person to leave the room was Miss Elaine Fortescue, her stepdaughter. Twenty minutes later, Miss Dove, who is the housekeeper, went in to remove the tea tray. Adele was sitting on the sofa, dead. Beside her was a tea cup a quarter full and in it was potassium cyanide.\'\n\n\'Such dangerous stuff,\' said Miss Marple quietly. \'Gardeners keep it to destroy insect nests, but I\'m always very, very careful.\'\n\n\'You\'re quite right,\' said Inspector Neele. \'There was a packet of it among the gardener\'s things.\'\n\n\'Very convenient,\' said Miss Marple. She added, \'Was Mrs Fortescue eating anything?\'\n\n\'Oh, yes.\'\n\n\'Cake, I suppose? Bread and butter? Jam? Honey?\'\n\n\'There was honey and scones and chocolate cake.\' He looked at her curiously. \'The potassium cyanide was in the tea, Miss Marple.\'\n\n\'Oh, yes, yes. I understand that. I was just getting the whole picture. Rather significant, don\'t you think?\'\n\nHe looked at her, slightly puzzled. Her eyes were bright. \'And the third death, Inspector Neele?\'\n\n\'Well, Gladys took in the tea tray, then she brought the next tray into the hall, but left it there. After that no one saw her. The cook, Mrs Crump, thought that the girl had gone out for the evening without permission. She thought that because the girl was wearing a good pair of nylon stockings and her best shoes. She was wrong. Gladys had obviously remembered suddenly that she had not taken in some clothes that were drying outside. She ran out to get them in and somebody put a stocking round her neck and - well, that was that. The girl was nervous, when we first questioned her, but I\'m afraid we didn\'t think that meant anything.\'\n\n\'Oh, but how could you?\' cried Miss Marple. \'People so often do look guilty and uncomfortable when they are questioned by the police.\'\n\n\'That\'s just it. But I think Gladys had seen someone doing something that she didn\'t understand - and I think she asked that person for an explanation.\'\n\n\'And so Gladys was strangled and a clothes peg put on her nose,\' Miss Marple said quietly.\n\n\'Yes, a nasty, unnecessary thing to do.\'\n\nMiss Marple shook her head. \'Hardly unnecessary. It does all make a pattern, doesn\'t it? First we have Rex Fortescue - killed in his office. And then we have Mrs Fortescue, sitting having tea. There were scones and honey. And then poor Gladys with the clothes peg on her nose. That very sweet Patricia Fortescue said that there seemed to be no rhyme or reason in it, but it\'s the rhyme that makes you think, isn\'t it?\'\n\nInspector Neele said slowly, \'I don\'t think...\'\n\nMiss Marple continued quickly, \'I expect you\'re about thirty-five or thirty-six, aren\'t you, Inspector Neele? I think that when you were a little boy, nursery rhymes were out of fashion. But I was brought up on them - and so, to me, it is really highly significant. What I wondered was...\' Miss Marple paused, then appearing to take her courage in her hands, continued, \'Of course I know I am very old and perhaps my idea is of no value at all, but what I mean to say is, have you thought about blackbirds?\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 30846, 11701),
(30849, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie\n\nPart 7\n\nInspector Neele\'s first thought was that the old lady had gone mad. \'Blackbirds?\' he repeated.\n\nMiss Marple nodded and said,\n\n\'Sing a song of sixpence, a pocketful of rye,\n\nFour and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.\n\nWhen the pie was opened the birds began to sing.\n\nWasn\'t that a dainty dish to set before the king?\n\nThe king was in his counting house, counting out his money,\n\nThe queen was in the parlour eating bread and honey,\n\nThe maid was in the garden hanging out the clothes,\n\nWhen there came a little dickey bird and nipped off her nose.\'\n\n\'My goodness,\' Inspector Neele said.\n\n\'I mean, it does fit,\' said Miss Marple. \'Rex Fortescue. Rex means King. In his Counting House, in other words at his place of work, dealing with money. And Mrs Fortescue, the Queen in the parlour, eating bread and honey. And so, of course, the murderer had to put that clothes peg on poor Gladys\'s nose.\'\n\n\'You mean the whole thing is crazy?\'\n\n\'Well, it is certainly very strange. But you really must make inquiries about blackbirds. Because there must be blackbirds!\'\n\nIt was at this point that Sergeant Hay came into the room saying urgently, \'Sir.\' He broke off at the sight of Miss Marple.\n\nInspector Neele said, \'Thank you, Miss Marple. I\'ll think about what you\'ve said. As you are interested in the girl, perhaps you would like to look at the things from her room. Sergeant Hay will show you them in a few minutes.\'\n\nMiss Marple nodded her head and went out.\n\n\'Blackbirds!\' said Inspector Neele to himself. \'Yes, Hay, what is it?\'\n\n\'Sir,\' said Sergeant Hay. \'Look at this.\' He showed him an object wrapped in a handkerchief. \'I found it in the bushes,\' said Sergeant Hay. \'It could have been thrown there from one of the back windows.\'\n\nIt was a nearly full pot of marmalade.\n\nIn his mind, the Inspector saw a new pot of marmalade; he saw hands carefully removing its cover; he saw a small amount of marmalade being removed, mixed with a preparation of Taxine and replaced in the pot, the top smoothed over and the lid carefully replaced.\n\n\'And,\' said Sergeant Hay, \'Mr Fortescue was the only one that had marmalade for breakfast. The others had jam or honey.\'\n\nNeele nodded. \'That made it very simple, didn\'t it?\' In his mind he saw the breakfast table now. Rex Fortescue stretching out his hand for the marmalade pot, taking out a spoonful and putting it on his toast. And afterwards? The pot of marmalade being replaced by another with exactly the same amount taken from it. And then an open window. A hand and an arm throwing that pot out into the bushes. The only thing he couldn\'t see was whose hand and arm it was.\n\nInspector Neele said in a business-like voice, \'Well, we\'ll have to get this analysed. How do they order marmalade and where is it kept?\'\n\n\'Marmalade comes in six pots at a time. A new pot would be taken into the pantry when the old one was nearly empty.\'\n\n\'That means,\' said Neele, \'that the Taxine could have been put into the marmalade several days before it was actually put onto the breakfast table. And anyone who was in the house, or who could have got into the house, could have done it.\'\n\nInspector Neele went to look for Mary Dove. She asked, \'Did you want to see me about something?\'\n\nNeele said pleasantly, \'It\'s becoming important to get exact times clear. Members of the family all seem a little unsure about times. You, Miss Dove, have been extremely accurate. Now, the last time you saw Gladys Martin was in the hall before tea, and that was at twenty minutes to five?\'\n\n\'Yes.\'\n\n\'Where were you coming from?\'\n\n\'From upstairs - I had heard the telephone.\'\n\n\'Gladys had answered the telephone?\'\n\n\'Yes. It was a wrong number,\' said Miss Dove.\n\n\'And that was the last time you saw her?\'\n\n\'She brought the tea tray into the library about ten minutes later.\'\n\n\'After that Miss Elaine Fortescue came in?\'\n\n\'Yes, about three minutes later. Then I went up to tell Mrs Jennifer tea was ready.\'\n\n\'Did you usually do that?\' Neele asked.\n\n\'No - people came in to tea when they pleased - but Mrs Adele Fortescue asked where everybody was. I thought I heard Mrs Jennifer coming - but that was a mistake...\'\n\nNeele interrupted. \'You mean you heard someone upstairs moving about?\'\n\n\'Yes - but no one came down, so I went up. Mrs Jennifer was in her bedroom. She had been out for a walk.\'\n\n\'The time was then...?\' asked Neele \'Oh - nearly five o\'clock.\'\n\nAnd Mr Lance Fortescue arrived - when?\'\n\n\'A few minutes after I came downstairs - I thought he had arrived earlier - but...\'\n\nInspector Neele interrupted, \'Why did you think he had arrived earlier?\'\n\n\'Because I thought I had seen him through the window. I caught a glimpse of someone through the yew bushes - and I thought it would be him.\'\n\n\'This was when you were coming down after telling Mrs Jennifer Fortescue tea was ready?\'\n\nMary corrected him, \'No, when I came down the first time.\' Inspector Neele kept his inner excitement out of his voice as he said, \'It couldn\'t have been Lance Fortescue. His train arrived at Baydon Heath at 4.37. He had to wait for a taxi. It was actually nearly a quarter to five (five minutes after you had seen the man in the garden) when he left the station and it is a ten-minute drive. He paid the taxi at the gate here at about five minutes to five at the earliest.\'\n\n\'I\'m sure I did see someone.\'\n\n\'He was going - which way?\'\n\n\'Along behind the yew bushes towards the east side of the house.\'\n\n\'There is a side door there. Is it kept locked?\'\n\n\'Not until the house is locked up for the night.\'\n\n\'Anyone could have come in by that side door without being seen by any of the household?\'\n\n\'Yes.\' She added quickly, \'You mean - the person I heard later upstairs could have come in that way? Could have been hiding - upstairs? But who...?\'\n\n\'That we have to find out. Thank you, Miss Dove.\'\n\nAs she turned to go, Inspector Neele said in a casual voice, \'By the way, you can\'t tell me anything about blackbirds, can you?\' For the first time Mary Dove looked surprised. \'You mean that silly business last summer? It must, I think, have been some nasty joke. Four dead blackbirds were on Mr Fortescue\'s desk in his study here, and then more were found in a pie.\'\n\n\'Any sort of reason behind it - any connection with blackbirds?\'\n\nMary shook her head. \'I don\'t think so.\'\n\n\'Was Mr Fortescue annoyed?\'\n\n\'Of course.\'\n\n\'But he was not upset in any way?\'\n\n\'I really can\'t remember.\'\n\n\'I see,\' said Inspector Neele.\n\nMary Dove once more turned away, but this time, he thought, she went slowly, as if she would like to know more of what was in his mind. Well, Miss Marple had suggested that there would be blackbirds and, sure enough, there the blackbirds were! Inspector Neele was not going to let this blackbird business take his attention away from the logical investigation of murder by a sane murderer for a sane reason. But of course he would still consider the crazier possibilities of the case.\n\nWhat Mary Dove had said about hearing someone moving about upstairs explained the small piece of mud Neele had found on the floor of the sitting room. He thought of the pretty desk in that room with its obvious \'secret\' drawer.\n\nHe had found three letters in that drawer, written by Vivian Dubois to Adele Fortescue. Neele had sent them up at once to the Yard because at that time it looked as if Rex Fortescue had been poisoned by his wife, with or without her lover\'s help. But there had been nothing in any of the letters to suggest that a crime was being planned. Inspector Neele believed that Dubois had asked Adele to destroy his letters and that she had told him she had done so.\n\nWell, now they had two more deaths to investigate. That should mean that Adele Fortescue had not killed her husband. Unless Adele Fortescue had wanted to marry Vivian Dubois and Vivian Dubois had wanted, not Adele, but the hundred thousand pounds which would come to her on the death of her husband. He had believed, perhaps, that Rex Fortescue\'s death would be blamed on natural causes.\n\nWhat if Adele Fortescue and Vivian Dubois had been guilty? Adele might have rung up Dubois, talking loudly and he had realized that someone in Yewtree Lodge might have overheard her. What would Vivian Dubois have done next?\n\nInspector Neele decided to make inquiries at the Golf Hotel to find out if Dubois had been in or out of the hotel between the hours of quarter past four and six o\'clock. Vivian Dubois was tall and dark like Lance Fortescue. He might have gone through the garden to the side door, gone upstairs and then what? Looked for the letters and found them missing? Or maybe waited until tea was over and then gone down to the library when Adele Fortescue was alone?\n\nBut all this was going too fast; he must see what Jennifer Fortescue had to say.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30848, 11701),
(30851, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie \n\nPart 8 \n\nJennifer Fortescue was in her own sitting room upstairs, writing letters.\n\n\'I\'m afraid,\' Neele said comfortingly, \'we have to ask people questions again and again, and so much depends on the exact timing of events. You came down to tea late, I understand? In fact, Miss Dove came up to get you.\'\n\n\'Yes, she did. I had no idea it was so late. I had been writing letters.\'\n\n\'I see,\' he said. \'I thought you had been out for a walk.\'\n\n\'Did she say so? Yes - I believe you\'re right. I felt I needed some fresh air and I went out and - er - went for a walk. Only round the garden.\'\n\n\'I see. You didn\'t meet anyone?\'\n\n\'Meet anyone? I saw the gardener in the distance, that\'s all.\' She was looking at him suspiciously.\n\n\'Then you came in, and you were just taking your coat off when Miss Dove came to tell you that tea was ready?\'\n\n\'Yes. Yes, and so I came down. We had tea. Then Lance went up to see Aunt Effie and I came up to finish my letters. I left Elaine with Adele.\'\n\nNeele nodded. \'Yes. Miss Elaine seems to have been with Mrs Adele Fortescue for five or ten minutes after you left. Your husband hadn\'t come home yet?\'\n\n\'Oh no. Percival didn\'t get home until about half-past six or seven.\'\n\n\'I see,\' said Inspector Neele. \'I asked your husband if Mrs Fortescue had made a will before she died. He said he thought not. I suppose you don\'t happen to have any idea?\'\n\n\'Oh, yes,\' she said, to his surprise. \'Adele made a will about a month ago. I saw her coming out of the solicitor\'s office, Ansell and Worrall\'s, in the High Street. And I said to her, \"Whatever have you been doing there?\" And she laughed and said, \"I\'ve been making my will. Everyone ought to make a will.\" She hadn\'t wanted to go to the family solicitor in London, Mr Billingsley. \"No,\" she said, \"my will\'s my own business, Jennifer, and nobody\'s going to know about it.\"\n\n\"Well,\" I said, \"I won\'t tell anybody.\" And I didn\'t tell anyone, not even Percival.\'\n\nWell, thank you very much, Mrs Fortescue, for being so helpful to me,\' said Inspector Neele. \'There\'s one other thing, Mrs Fortescue. Do you know anything about blackbirds?\'\n\nJennifer Fortescue looked shocked. \'Blackbirds, Inspector? What kind of blackbirds?\'\n\n\'Just blackbirds. Alive or dead or even, shall we say, in a nursery rhyme?\'\n\nShe said slowly, \'I suppose you mean the ones last summer in the pie. All very silly.\'\n\n\'There were some left on the library table, too, weren\'t there?\'\n\n\'It was all a very silly joke. Mr Fortescue, my father-in-law, was very much annoyed by it. He asked us if there were any strangers about the place.\'\n\n\'Strangers? Did he seem afraid in any way?\'\n\n\'Yes. Yes, he did.\'\n\n***\n\nPercival Fortescue was in London, but Inspector Neele found his brother Lance sitting with his wife Pat in the library.\n\n\'Do you know anything about blackbirds, Mr Fortescue?\'\n\n\'Blackbirds?\' Lance looked amused. \'Do you mean real birds?\' Inspector Neele said with a sudden, sweet smile, \'I\'m not sure what I mean, Mr Fortescue. It\'s just that blackbirds have been mentioned.\'\n\n\'Good Lord. Not the old Blackbird Mine, I suppose?\'\n\n\'The Blackbird Mine? What was that?\'\n\nLance frowned. \'I just have an idea about some unpleasant business in my papa\'s past, on the west coast of Africa. Aunt Effie once mentioned it when she was having an argument with him, but I can\'t remember much about it.\'\n\n\'I\'ll go and ask her about it,\' said Inspector Neele, adding, \'She\'s rather a frightening old lady.\'\n\nLance laughed. \'Yes. But she may be helpful to you, Inspector. I went up to see her, you know, soon after I got back here. And she was talking about Gladys, the maid who got killed. Not that we knew she was dead then, of course. But Aunt Effie was saying she was quite sure that Gladys knew something that she hadn\'t told the police.\'\n\n\'That seems fairly certain,\' said Inspector Neele. \'She\'ll never tell it now, poor girl.\'\n\nTo his surprise, when he went up to see Miss Ramsbottom, he found Miss Marple with her, discussing foreign missions.\n\n\'I\'ll go away, Inspector.\' Miss Marple rose to her feet.\n\n\'No need, Madam,\' said Inspector Neele.\n\n\'I\'ve asked Miss Marple to come and stay,\' said Miss Ramsbottom. \'There is no sense in her spending her money in that Golf Hotel. It\'s a wicked place. Drinking and card playing all the evening. She had better come and stay in a respectable household. There\'s a room next door to mine.\'\n\n\'It\'s very kind of you,\' said Miss Marple gratefully. \'I\'ll go and cancel my booking.\' She left the room and Miss Ramsbottom said sharply to the Inspector, \'Well, and what do you want?\'\n\n\'I wondered if you could tell me anything about the Blackbird Mine, Madam.\'\n\nMiss Ramsbottom gave a shout of laughter. \'Ha. You\'ve got on to that, have you! Well, what do you want to know about it?\'\n\n\'Anything you can tell me, Madam.\'\n\n\'I can\'t tell you much. It\'s a long time ago now - oh, twenty to twenty-five years maybe, in East Africa. My brother-in-law went into business with a man called MacKenzie. They went out there to investigate the mine together and MacKenzie died of fever. Rex came home and said there was no gold in the mine. That\'s all I know.\'\n\n\'I think you know a little more than that, Madam,\' said Neele. \'Well, the MacKenzies insisted that Rex had cheated MacKenzie and he probably had, but they couldn\'t prove anything. Mrs MacKenzie came here and said Rex had murdered her husband. I think she was a bit mad - in fact, I believe she went into a hospital for the insane not long after. She came here with a couple of young children who looked scared to death. She said she would bring up her children to get revenge. Madness, all of it. Well, that\'s all I can tell you. And the Blackbird Mine wasn\'t the only bad thing that Rex did in his lifetime. You\'ll find a good many more if you look for them.\'\n\n\'You don\'t know what happened to the MacKenzie family, Madam?\'\n\n\'No idea,\' said Miss Ramsbottom. \'And I don\'t think Rex would have actually murdered MacKenzie, but he might have left him to die. If he did, then he\'s been paid back. You should go away now, I can\'t tell you any more.\'\n\n\'Thank you very much for what you have told me,\' said Inspector Neele.\n\n\'Send that Marple woman back,\' Miss Ramsbottom called after him. \'She knows how to organize things properly.\'\n\nInspector Neele made a couple of telephone calls, the first to Adele Fortescue\'s lawyers, Ansell and Worrall and the second to the Golf Hotel, then he told Sergeant Hay, \'I have to visit a solicitor\'s office - after that, you can find me at the Golf Hotel if anything urgent happens.\'\n\nMr Ansell was anxious to help the police in every way possible. Yes, he said, he had made a will for the late Mrs Adele Fortescue. He had not done any legal business before that for Mrs Fortescue or for any of the Fortescue family. \'Naturally,\' said Mr Ansell, \'she didn\'t want to go to her husband\'s firm of lawyers.\'\n\nThe facts were simple. Adele Fortescue had made a will leaving everything she possessed to Vivian Dubois.\n\n\'But I understood,\' said Mr Ansell, \'that she didn\'t actually have much to leave.\'\n\nInspector Neele nodded. At the time Adele Fortescue made her will that was true. But since then Rex Fortescue had died, and Adele Fortescue had inherited 100,000 pounds and that now belonged to Vivian Edward Dubois.\n\n***\n\nAt the Golf Hotel, Inspector Neele found Vivian Dubois nervously waiting for him.\n\n\'I do hope you realize, Inspector Neele, that it is very inconvenient for me to have to stay on. I really have important business.\'\n\n\'I didn\'t know you were in business, Mr Dubois,\' said Inspector Neele in a friendly way. \'Mrs Fortescue\'s death must have been a terrible shock to you. You were great friends, were you not?\'\n\n\'Yes, the whole thing is terrible.\'\n\n\'You actually telephoned her, I believe, on the afternoon of her death? About four o\'clock. Do you remember what your conversation was about, Mr Dubois?\'\n\n\'I think I asked her how she was feeling and if there was any further news about her husband\'s death - a more or less ordinary inquiry.\'\n\n\'I see,\' said Inspector Neele. \'And then you went out for a walk?\'\n\n\'Er - not a walk, I went and played golf.\'\n\n\'I think not, Mr Dubois. The doorman here saw you walking down the road towards Yewtree Lodge.\'\n\nDubois\'s eyes met his, then moved away again nervously. \'I\'m afraid I can\'t remember, Inspector.\'\n\n\'Perhaps you actually went to visit Mrs Fortescue?\'\n\nDubois said sharply, \'No. No. I never went near the house.\'\n\n\'Where did you go, then?\'\n\n\'Oh, I... down the road as far as the pub. The Three Pigeons, and then I turned around and came back by the golf course.\' The Inspector shook his head. \'You know, Mr Dubois,\' he said pleasantly, \'I think we\'ll have to ask you for a statement and perhaps you should have a solicitor present.\'\n\nThe colour left Dubois\' face. \'You\'re threatening me! I had nothing to do with it at all, I tell you! Nothing!\'\n\n\'Come now, Mr Dubois, you were at Yewtree Lodge about half-past four on that day. Somebody saw you. Didn\'t you go in by the side door and up the stairs to Mrs Fortescue\'s sitting room? You were looking for something in the desk there?\'\n\n\'You\'ve got the letters, I suppose,\' said Dubois. \'But they don\'t mean what you think they mean.\'\n\n\'You\'re not denying are you, that you were a very close friend of Mrs Fortescue\'s?\'\n\n\'No - but don\'t think that we - that she - ever thought of killing Rex Fortescue. I\'m not that kind of man!\'\n\n\'But perhaps she was that kind of woman?\'\n\n\'Nonsense! Wasn\'t she killed, too? So didn\'t the same person who killed her husband kill her?\'\n\n\'Possibly. But it\'s also possible that Mrs Fortescue murdered her husband, and that after his death she became a danger to someone else. Someone who had, perhaps, not helped her with what she had done but who had at least encouraged her and provided the motive. She might be a danger to that person.\'\n\nDubois said nervously, \'You can\'t build up a case against me. You can\'t.\'\n\n\'She left all her money to you.\'\n\n\'I don\'t want the money!\'\n\n\'Of course, it isn\'t very much,\' said Inspector Neele.\n\n\'But I thought her husband...\' He stopped dead.\n\n\'Did you, Mr Dubois?\' said Inspector Neele, and there was no friendliness now in his voice. \'That\'s very interesting. I wondered if you knew exactly what Rex Fortescue\'s will said.\'\n\n***\n\nInspector Neele\'s second interview at the hotel was with Mr Gerald Wright, a very superior young man, not unlike Vivian Dubois in appearance.\n\n\'What can I do for you, Inspector Neele?\' he asked.\n\n\'I thought you might be able to help us with a little information, Mr Wright, in connection with the recent events at Yewtree Lodge.\'\n\n\'I know nothing. I was actually in the Isle of Man when Mr Rex Fortescue was killed.\'\n\n\'You arrived here very shortly afterwards, Mr Wright. You had a telegram, I believe, from Miss Elaine Fortescue. And you are, I understand, to be married?\'\n\n\'Quite right, Inspector Neele.\'\n\n\'I understand that Mr Fortescue refused to give his permission and told you that if his daughter married against his wishes, he would not give her any money to live on. You then broke off the engagement.\'\n\nGerald Wright smiled. \'Not exactly true, Inspector Neele. Actually, Rex Fortescue was a capitalist and my political beliefs would not let me live off his money.\'\n\n\'But you have no objection to marrying a woman who has just inherited 50,000 pounds?\'\n\nGerald Wright gave a satisfied smile. \'Not at all, Inspector Neele. The money will be used to help other people.\'\n\n\'Mr Wright, Mrs Adele Fortescue died as a result of cyanide poisoning on the afternoon of November 5th. As you were in the neighbourhood of Yewtree Lodge on that afternoon, I thought you might have seen or heard something that might help our investigations.\'\n\n\'And why do you believe that I was in the neighbourhood of Yewtree Lodge?\'\n\n\'You left this hotel at a quarter-past four. After you left the hotel you walked down the road towards Yewtree Lodge. It seems natural to believe that you were going there.\'\n\n\'I already had an arrangement to meet Elaine at the hotel at six. I went for a walk and returned to the hotel just before six o\'clock. Elaine, quite naturally, did not keep her appointment.\'\n\n\'Did anybody see you on this walk, Mr Wright?\'\n\n\'No one I knew.\'\n\n\'So I\'ve only got your word that you were where you say you were?\'\n\nGerald Wright continued to smile in a superior way, \'Very sad for us both, Inspector, but there it is.\'\n\nInspector Neele said softly, \'Then if someone said they looked out of a window and saw you in the garden of Yewtree Lodge at about four thirty-five...\' He paused and left the sentence unfinished.\n\nGerald Wright shook his head. \'It was getting dark by then. I think it would be difficult for anyone to be sure.\'\n\n\'Do you know Mr Vivian Dubois, who is also staying here?\'\n\n\'Dubois? Is that the tall, dark man who wears very brightly coloured ties?\'\n\n\'Yes. He also was out for a walk that afternoon. You did not notice him in the road by any chance?\'\n\n\'No. No. I can\'t say I did.\' Gerald Wright looked for the first time slightly worried.\n\nInspector Neele said thoughtfully, \'It wasn\'t really a very nice afternoon for walking, especially after dark. It\'s strange how full of energy everyone seems to have felt.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 30850, 11701);

Mind you, I don\'t trust Lance, but I can\'t help being fond of him. He\'s a reckless sort of boy - always has been. You\'ve got to look after him and see he doesn\'t go too far. Tell him not to believe everything that Percival says. They\'re all liars in this house.\'\n\n***\n\nThe triple tragedy at Yewtree Lodge had shocked the Fortescues\' lawyer, Mr Billingsley. He was only too anxious to help the police. \'It\'s a most extraordinary business. I\'ll tell you whatever I can.\'\n\n\'First let me ask you how well you knew Mr Rex Fortescue, and how well you know the affairs of his firm.\'\n\n\'I\'ve known Rex Fortescue for sixteen years - although we are not the only firm of solicitors he employed.\'\n\nInspector Neele nodded. Billingsley, Horsethorpe & Walters were respectable solicitors. For his less honest business, Rex Fortescue had employed less honest firms.\n\n\'Now what do you want to know?\'\n\n\'I\'m interested in the will of his widow. On Mr Fortescue\'s death she inherited the sum of one hundred thousand pounds, I understand?\'\n\nBillingsley nodded. \'A large amount of money. And one the firm would have found difficult to pay out.\'\n\n\'The firm is not doing well?\'\n\n\'Well, Consolidated Investments Trust was doing very well, buying and selling stocks and shares wisely. But for the last year Rex Fortescue had been acting like a madman. Selling good stock here, buying very questionable projects there. Really, he seemed to have been a changed man.\'\n\n\'But not, I understand, a depressed man,\' said Inspector Neele. \'No, no. The opposite. He had become very overexcited and convinced only he knew how to run the firm.\'\n\nInspector Neele nodded. An idea was forming in his mind. Mr Billingsley was continuing, \'But it\'s no good asking me about the wife\'s will. I didn\'t make any will for her.\'\n\n\'I know that,\' said Neele. \'I\'m simply checking that she had a hundred thousand pounds from Rex Fortescue\'s will to leave.\' Mr Billingsley was shaking his head. \'No, no, my dear Sir. She did not inherit the hundred thousand pounds unless she lived for one month after his death.\'\n\nInspector Neele was staring at him. \'Then what happens to that money?\'\n\n\'It goes to Mr Percival Fortescue. And with the firm in a poor condition, I would say that he\'ll need it!\'\n\nIn the drawing room at Yewtree Lodge, the whole Fortescue family was together.\n\n \n\n\'I think we might discuss future plans,\' said Percival. \'I suppose you\'ll be off again back to Kenya - or Canada - or climbing Mount Everest or something fairly exciting, Lance?\'\n\n\'Now what makes you think that?\' Lance smiled. \'I\'m coming into the firm with you. I have got the share in it that Father gave me years ago and that gives me the right to be involved, doesn\'t it?\'\n\nPercival frowned. \'Things are in a very bad way, you know. We\'ll only just be able to pay Elaine her share, if she insists on having it. So are you serious, Lance?\'\n\n\'Completely serious.\'\n\n\'It won\'t work! You\'ll soon get bored,\' Percival said.\n\n\'Why are you so angry, dear brother? Don\'t you look forward to having me sharing your problems?\'\n\n\'You haven\'t the slightest idea of the mess everything\'s in,\' replied Percival. \'For the last six months - no, a year, Father was not himself. He sold good stock and bought some very strange investments.\'\n\n\'In fact,\' said Lance, \'it\'s just as well for the family that he had Taxine in his tea.\'\n\n\'That\'s a very ugly way of putting it, but it\'s about the only thing that saved us from bankruptcy. We shall have to be very careful for a while.\'\n\nLance shook his head. \'I don\'t agree with you. We must take a few risks, go for something big.\'\n\nPercival walked up and down angrily. \'It\'s no good, Lance. Our ways of doing business are totally different. The only sensible thing is to end the partnership.\'\n\n\'You\'re going to buy me out - is that the idea?\'\n\n\'Well, I didn\'t mean in cash,\' said Percival. \'We could - er - divide everything up.\'\n\n\'With you keeping the best bits and me getting the mad investments Father bought recently, I suppose?\'\n\n\'They seem to be what you prefer,\' said Percival.\n\nLance grinned. \'You\'re right in a way, old boy. But I\'ve got Pat here to think of.\'\n\nPat opened her mouth, then shut it again. Whatever game Lance was playing, it was best that she did not become involved.\n\n\'So what are you planning to give me?\' said Lance, laughing. \'Diamond mines that have no diamonds, the oil fields where no oil has been found? Do you think I\'m quite as big a fool as I look?\'\n\nPercival said, \'Of course, some of these things that Father bought have turned out to be worthless, but some of them may turn out to be very valuable.\'\n\nLance grinned. \'Are you going to offer me the old Blackbird Mine as well? By the way, has the Inspector been asking you about this Blackbird Mine?\'\n\nPercival frowned. \'Yes, he did. I couldn\'t tell him much. You and I were children at the time. I just remember that Father went out there and came back saying the whole thing was no good.\'\n\n\'What was it - a gold mine?\'\n\n\'I believe so. Father came back certain that there was no gold there.\'\n\n\'Who involved him in it? A man called MacKenzie, wasn\'t it? And MacKenzie died out there. I seem to remember... Mrs MacKenzie, wasn\'t it? She came here and accused Father of murdering her husband.\'\n\n\'Really?\' said Percival. \'I can\'t remember anything like that.\'\n\n\'I do, though,\' said Lance. \'Where was Blackbird? West Africa wasn\'t it?\'\n\n\'Yes, I think so.\'\n\n\'I must find the paperwork on it sometime,\' said Lance, \'when I\'m at the office.\'\n\n\'You can be quite sure,\' said Percival, \'that if Father came back saying there was no gold, there was no gold.\'\n\n\'You\'re probably right there,\' said Lance. \'Poor Mrs MacKenzie.

Helen MacKenzie was sixty-three, though she looked younger. She was holding a large book and was looking down at it as Inspector Neele talked to her.\n\n\'She\'s a voluntary patient,\' Dr Crosbie, the sanatorium\'s director, had told him. \'Most of the time she\'s as sane as you or me. It\'s one of her good days today, so you\'ll be able to have a completely normal conversation with her.\'\n\nInspector Neele said now, \'It\'s very kind of you to see me, Madam. My name is Neele. I\'ve come to see you about a Mr Rex Fortescue, who has recently died. I expect you know the name.\' Mrs MacKenzie said, \'I don\'t know what you\'re talking about.\'\n\n\'I think, Mrs MacKenzie, you knew him many years ago.\'\n\n\'Not really,\' said Mrs MacKenzie. \'It was yesterday.\'\n\n\'I see,\' said Inspector Neele. \'I believe that you paid him a visit many years ago at Yewtree Lodge.\'\n\n\'A house decorated with money, but no taste,\' said Mrs MacKenzie.\n\n\'He had been connected with your husband, I believe, over a certain mine in Africa.

He went to Rex Fortescue.\'\n\n\'And they went out together to Africa, and your husband died of fever.\'\n\n\'I must read my book,\' said Mrs MacKenzie.\n\n\'Do you think Mr Fortescue cheated your husband over the Blackbird Mine, Mrs MacKenzie?\'\n\nWithout raising her eyes from the book, Mrs MacKenzie said, \'How stupid you are.\'\n\n\'Yes, yes, perhaps... But you see, finding out about a thing that was over a long time ago is rather difficult.\'\n\n\'Who said it was over? Nobody knows where my husband died or how he died or where he was buried.

They were nine and seven and left without a father. I told them every day. I made them promise every night.\'\n\nInspector Neele leant forward. \'What did you make them promise?\'\n\n\'That they would kill him, of course.\'\n\nInspector Neele spoke as though it was the most reasonable comment in the world. \'Did they?\'\n\n\'Donald went to fight in France. They sent me a telegram saying that he had been killed in action. Action, you see, the wrong kind of action.\'\n\n\'I\'m sorry to hear that, Madam. What about your daughter?\'\n\n\'Do you know what I\'ve done to Ruby? Look here at the Book.\'\n\nHe saw then that what she was holding in her lap was a very old family Bible in which the old-fashioned custom had been continued of entering each new birth. Mrs MacKenzie pointed to the two last names. Donald MacKenzie with the date of his birth, and Ruby MacKenzie with the date of hers. But a thick line was drawn through Ruby MacKenzie\'s name.\n\n\'You see?\' said Mrs MacKenzie. \'I crossed her out of the Book. She doesn\'t exist anymore!\'\n\n\'Why, Madam?\'\n\nMrs MacKenzie looked at him slyly. \'She didn\'t do as I said.\'\n\n\'Where is your daughter now, Madam?\'\n\n\'There isn\'t such a person as Ruby MacKenzie any longer.\' Mrs MacKenzie refused to say more and Neele had another short interview with Dr Crosbie.\n\n\'Do any of her relations come to see her?\' he asked.\n\n\'I believe a daughter did come to see her before my time here, but her visit upset the patient so much that they advised her not to come again. Since then everything has been arranged through solicitors.\'\n\nInspector Neele had already been to see those solicitors. They were unable, or said they were unable, to tell him anything. A trust fund had been arranged for Mrs MacKenzie, which they managed.\n\n\'So there we are, Sir,\' said Inspector Neele as he reported to the Assistant Commissioner. \'It\'s crazy, but it all fits together. It must mean something.\'\n\nThe Assistant Commissioner nodded. \'The blackbirds in the pie and the Blackbird Mine, rye in the dead man\'s pocket, bread and honey with Adele Fortescue\'s tea, that girl strangled with a stocking and a clothes peg put on her nose. Yes, crazy as it all is, it certainly can\'t be ignored.\'\n\n\'Half a minute, Sir,\' said Inspector Neele.\n\n\'What is it?\'\n\nNeele was frowning. \'You know, what you\'ve just said. It was wrong somewhere.\' He shook his head. \'No. I can\'t see it.\'\n\nLance and Pat walked around the grounds of Yewtree Lodge. \'There\'s something extremely frightening about a poisoner,\' said Pat. \'I mean they must have a terrible mind, filled with thoughts of revenge.\'\n\n\'Funny! I just think of it as business-like and cold-blooded.\'\n\n\'To do three murders... Whoever did it must be mad,\' Pat said.\n\n\'Yes,\' said Lance, in a low voice. \'I\'m afraid so. Please, Pat, go back to London - it worries me to death to have you here.\'\n\nPat said quietly, \'You know who it is, don\'t you?\'\n\n\'No, I don\'t.\'\n\n\'But you think you know... That\'s why you\'re frightened for me. I wish you would tell me. But I\'m staying here. Lance, you\'re my husband and my place is here with you.\' She added, \'Although maybe you would be better without me - because I always bring bad luck to the men I love.\'\n\n\'My dearest, you haven\'t brought bad luck to me. Look how after I married you, Father sent for me to come home and make friends with him.\'\n\n\'Yes, and what happened when you did come home? I tell you, I\'m unlucky to people.\'\n\nLance took her by the shoulders and shook her. \'You\'re my Pat and to be married to you is the greatest luck in the world. But Pat, I just wish you\'d go away from here.\'\n\n\'Darling,\' said Pat. \'I\'m not going.\'\n\n\'Then when I\'m not around, stay close to that old lady. What\'s-her-name? Marple. Why do you think Aunt Effie asked her to stay here?\'\n\n\'Goodness knows why Aunt Effie does anything. Lance, how long are we going to stay here? The house belongs to your brother now and he doesn\'t really want us here, does he? Are we going back to East Africa or what?\'\n\n\'Is that what you\'d like to do, Pat?\' She nodded.\n\n\'That\'s lucky,\' said Lance, \'because it\'s what I\'d like to do, too.\' Pat\'s face brightened. \'From what you said the other day, I was afraid you might want to stay here.\'\n\n\'You mustn\'t say anything about our plans, Pat,\' Lance said. \'I want to worry Percival a little longer.\'\n\n\'Oh, Lance, do be careful.\'\n\n\'I\'ll be careful, my sweet, but I don\'t see why he should always get what he wants!\'\n\n***\n\nWith her head a little on one side, Miss Marple sat in the large drawing-room listening to Jennifer Fortescue. Jennifer had a lot of complaints and the relief of telling them to a stranger was huge.\n\n\'Of course I never want to complain,\' said Jennifer. \'What I always say is that I must put up with things and I\'m sure I\'ve never said a word to anyone, but in some ways I feel very lonely here. Fortunately our new house is almost ready to move into. My husband, of course, has been quite satisfied living here. But then it\'s different for a man. Don\'t you agree?\'\n\nMiss Marple agreed, and it was what she really believed. Men needed two eggs plus bacon for breakfast, three good meals a day and were never to be argued with before dinner. Jennifer continued. \'My husband, you see, is away all day in the city. But I am alone here with no pleasant company at all. The people round here are really not my kind. They\'re all very rich down here. They play cards for money, and there\'s a great deal of drinking. And I don\'t want to say anything against the dead, but my mother-in-law was absolutely man-mad. And the way she spent money! It troubled Percival very much, very much indeed. And then what with Mr Fortescue being so terribly angry some days and spending huge amounts of money. Well - it wasn\'t at all nice.\'\n\n\'That must have worried your husband, too?\' asked Miss Marple.\n\n\'Oh, yes, it did. For the last year he\'s been very worried indeed. He changed, even towards me. Then Elaine, my sister- in-law, she\'s a very strange sort of girl. She never wants to go to London and shop, or go to a play. She isn\'t even interested in clothes.\' Jennifer sighed. \'You must think it most strange, talking to you like this when we really don\'t know one another...\'\n\n\'Not at all strange, my dear, I know just how you feel,\' said Miss Marple. And this again was true. Jennifer\'s husband was obviously bored by her and the poor woman hadn\'t made any local friends. \'I hope it\'s not rude of me to say so,\' said Miss Marple in a gentle old lady\'s voice, \'but I really feel that Mr Rex Fortescue cannot have been a very nice man.\'\n\n\'He wasn\'t,\' said his daughter-in-law. \'He was a horrible old man. It\'s not surprising that someone murdered him.\'\n\n\'You\'ve no idea at all who...\' began Miss Marple and broke off. \'Oh dear, perhaps this is a question I should not ask - not even an idea who - who - well, who it might have been?\'\n\n\'Oh, I think it was that horrible man Crump,\' said Jennifer. \'I\'ve always disliked him very much.\'\n\n\'Still, there would have to be a motive.\'\n\n\'I really don\'t know if that sort of person needs much motive. Of course, I did suspect that it was Adele who poisoned Mr Fortescue. But now we can\'t suspect that as she\'s been poisoned herself. Oh dear, sometimes I feel I must get away - that if it doesn\'t all stop soon, I shall - I shall actually run away.\' She leant back, studying Miss Marple\'s face. \'But perhaps - that wouldn\'t be wise?\'\n\n\'No - I don\'t think it would be very wise - the police could soon find you, you know.\'\n\n\'You think they\'re clever enough for that?\'\n\n\'It is very foolish to underestimate the police. Inspector Neele seems to be a particularly intelligent man,\' said Miss Marple.\n\n\'I can\'t help feeling...\' Jennifer Fortescue hesitated, \'that it\'s dangerous to stay here.\'\n\n\'Dangerous for you, you mean? Because of something you - know?\'\n\n\'Oh no - of course I don\'t know anything. What should I know? It\'s just - just that I\'m nervous. That man Crump...\'\n\nBut it was not, Miss Marple thought, of Crump that Mrs Jennifer Fortescue was thinking. And for some reason Jennifer Fortescue was very badly frightened indeed.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30854, 11701),
(30857, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie\n\nPart 11\n\nIt was getting dark. Miss Marple had taken her knitting over to the glass doors in the library. Looking out she saw Pat Fortescue walking up and down outside. Miss Marple opened the door and called, \'Come in, my dear. It\'s much too damp for you to be out there without a coat on.\'\n\nPat came in and closed the door behind her and turned on two of the lamps. \'Yes,\' she said, \'it\'s not a very nice afternoon.\' She sat down on the sofa by Miss Marple. \'What are you making?\'\n\n\'Oh, just a little baby\'s coat, dear. I always make the second size. Babies so soon grow out of the first size.\'\n\nPat stretched out long legs towards the fire. \'It\'s nice in here today,\' she said. \'With the fire and the lamps and you knitting things for babies. It all seems just like England ought to be.\'\n\n\'It\'s like England is,\' said Miss Marple. \'There are not so many Yewtree Lodges, my dear.\'\n\n\'I don\'t believe anybody was ever happy here, in spite of all the money and the things they had. Oh, how I want to get away from here!\' She looked at Miss Marple and smiled suddenly. \'Do you know, Lance told me to stay as close to you as I could. He seemed to think I would be safe that way.\'\n\n\'Your husband\'s no fool,\' said Miss Marple.\n\n\'No. Somebody in this house is mad, and madness is always frightening, because you don\'t know how mad people\'s minds will work. You don\'t know what they\'ll do next.\'\n\n\'My poor child,\' said Miss Marple.\n\n\'Oh, I\'m all right, really. I ought to be tough enough by now.\' Miss Marple said gently, \'You\'ve had a lot of unhappiness, haven\'t you, my dear?\'\n\n\'Oh, I\'ve had some very good times, too. I had a lovely childhood in Ireland, riding horses, swimming in the sea when the weather was good... It was afterwards - when I grew up - that things seemed always to go wrong.\'\n\n\'Your first husband was a pilot in the war, wasn\'t he?\'\n\n\'Yes. We had only been married about a month when Don\'s plane was shot down. I thought at first I wanted to die, too. And yet - in the end - I almost began to see that it had been the best thing. Don was brave and reckless - all the qualities that are needed in a war. But I don\'t believe peace would have suited him. He would have fought against things. He was - well, antisocial in a way. No, he wouldn\'t have fitted in.\'\n\n\'It\'s wise of you to see that, my dear. And your second husband?\'\n\n\'Freddy? We were very happy together, but Freddy wasn\'t very honest in his horse-racing business. However, it didn\'t seem to matter, between us two, that is. Because, you see, Freddy loved me and I loved him and I tried not to know what was happening. That wasn\'t very brave, I suppose, but I couldn\'t have changed him you know. You can\'t change people.\'\n\n\'No,\' said Miss Marple, \'you can\'t change people.\'\n\n\'Then things went wrong and he shot himself and I went out to Kenya to stay with some friends there. And I met Lance.\' Her face softened, then after a short pause she said, \'Tell me, Miss Marple, what do you really think of Percival?\'\n\n\'Well, I don\'t think he likes my being here very much.\'\n\nPat laughed suddenly. \'He\'s mean. He goes over the housekeeping accounts with Miss Dove, complaining about every item. But Miss Dove manages to win every time. She\'s really rather wonderful, don\'t you think?\'\n\n\'Yes, indeed,\' agreed Miss Marple. \'She reminds me of Mrs Latimer in my own village, St Mary Mead. She ran the Girl\n\nGuides, and indeed, she ran practically everything there. She had been doing it for five years when we discovered that... oh, but I mustn\'t gossip. You must forgive me, my dear.\'\n\n\'Is St Mary Mead a very nice village?\'\n\n\'Well, it\'s quite a pretty village. There are some nice people living in it and some extremely unpleasant people as well. Human nature is much the same everywhere, is it not?\'\n\n\'You go up and see Miss Ramsbottom a lot, don\'t you?\' said Pat. \'Now she really frightens me. She sits up there and thinks about wickedness. Well, she might have felt in the end that it was up to her to deliver justice.\'\n\n\'Is that what your husband thinks?\'\n\n\'I don\'t know what Lance thinks about the murders really. But I\'m quite sure of one thing - that he believes that the murderer is someone who\'s mad, and it\'s someone in the family. And I don\'t see how it can be anybody from outside. And so - and so that\'s why there\'s this terrible atmosphere here. Everyone is watching everybody else. Only something\'s got to happen soon.\'\n\n\'There won\'t be any more deaths,\' said Miss Marple. \'The murderer\'s got what he or she wanted, you see.\'\n\n\'And what is that?\'\n\nMiss Marple shook her head - she was not yet quite sure herself.\n\n \n\nIn the office of Consolidated Investments, once again Miss Somers had just made tea in the typists\' room, and once again the kettle had not been boiling. As so often before, Miss Griffith said sharply, \'The water\'s not boiling again, Somers,\' but she was interrupted by the entrance of Lance Fortescue. Miss Griffith jumped up. \'Mr Lance,\' she exclaimed.\n\nHis face lit up in a smile. \'Hello, Miss Griffith.\'\n\nMiss Griffith was delighted. Eleven years since he had seen her and he knew her name. She said in an excited voice, \'You remember me!\'\n\nAnd Lance said easily, smiling his attractive smile, \'Of course I remember.\' He looked round him. \'So everything\'s still going on just the same here.\'\n\n\'Not many changes, Mr Lance. I suppose you must have had a very interesting life abroad.\'\n\n\'You could call it that,\' said Lance, \'but perhaps I am now going to try and have an interesting life in London.\'\n\n\'You\'re coming back here to the office?\'\n\n\'Maybe. You\'ll have to show me how everything works again, Miss Griffith.\'\n\nMiss Griffith laughed delightedly. \'It will be very nice to have you back, Mr Lance. Very nice indeed. We never believed - none of us thought...\' Miss Griffith broke off.\n\nLance patted her on the arm. \'You didn\'t believe I was as guilty as it seemed I was? Well, perhaps I wasn\'t. But that\'s all old history now. The future\'s the important thing now.\' He added, \'Is my brother here?\'\n\n\'He\'s in the inner office.\'\n\nLance nodded and walked on through to his father\'s office. Somewhat to his surprise it was not Percival who was sitting behind the desk there, but Inspector Neele.\n\n\'Good morning, Mr Fortescue. Are you really going to become a city man? It doesn\'t seem the kind of life that would suit you.\' Lance sat down, smiling. \'You\'re more intelligent than my brother, Inspector. Percival thinks I\'ve decided to join the firm again and that I\'ll spend the firm\'s money on risky investments. It would be almost worth doing just for the fun of it! But I couldn\'t really stand an office life. However, I want to make him worry a bit. I\'ve got to have just a little revenge!\'\n\n\'There was a problem with a forged cheque some years ago, I understand. Would that be what you want revenge for?\' enquired Inspector Neele.\n\n\'How much you know, Inspector!\'\n\n\'There was no question of prosecution, I understand,\' said Neele. \'Your father wouldn\'t have done that.\'\n\n\'No. He just got rid of me, that\'s all.\'\n\nInspector Neele thought about Percival. It seemed to him that wherever his investigations got in the case, there was Percival Fortescue. On the surface, he seemed to be a man who had never said no to his father. Neele was trying now, through Lance, to learn more about Percival\'s personality. \'Your brother seems always to have been very much - well, how shall I put it - controlled by your father.\'\n\n\'I don\'t know,\' Lance said. \'I\'m not sure that it was really the truth. It\'s amazing, when I look back through life, to see how Percival always got what he wanted without seeming to do so, if you know what I mean.\'\n\nNeele pushed a letter across the desk towards Lance. \'This is a letter you wrote last August, isn\'t it, Mr Fortescue?\'\n\n\'Yes,\' he said, \'I wrote it after I got back to Kenya last summer, saying I would re-join the firm. Where was it - here in the office?\'\n\n\'No, it was among your father\'s papers in Yewtree Lodge. Where did you address this letter, Mr Fortescue?\'\n\nLance frowned. \'The office. Why?\'\n\n\'I wondered,\' said Inspector Neele. \'Your father did not put it on the file here among his private papers. I found it in his desk at Yewtree Lodge there. I wondered why he would have done that.\' Lance laughed. \'To hide it from Percival, I suppose. He always did read other people\'s letters. And just look who\'s here!\'\n\nPercival Fortescue came in. About to speak to the Inspector he stopped, frowning, as he saw Lance. \'Hello,\' he said. \'You didn\'t tell me you were coming here today.\'\n\n\'Oh, I felt I had to come and get started on my new working life,\' said Lance. \'By the way, why did you get rid of the old man\'s glamorous secretary, Grosvenor? Did you think she knew a bit too much?\'\n\n\'Of course not. What an idea!\' Percy spoke angrily. He turned to the Inspector. \'You mustn\'t pay any attention to my brother,\' he said coldly. \'He has a rather strange sense of humour. I never had a very high opinion of Miss Grosvenor\'s intelligence and in any case, we have to save money - the firm is in a bad state.\'\n\n\'That\'s one of the things I wanted to talk to you about, Mr Fortescue,\' Inspector Neele said to Percival.\n\n\'Yes, Inspector?\'\n\n\'I understand that your father\'s recent behaviour made you worry and you tried to make him see a doctor, but he refused?\'\n\n\'That is correct.\'\n\n\'May I ask you if you suspected that your father had one of those mental illnesses which make people behave in an extreme way?\'\n\n\'That is exactly what I did suspect.\'\n\nNeele continued, \'So from the business point of view, your father\'s death was very fortunate.\'\n\n\'You can\'t believe that I would think of my father\'s death in that way!\'\n\n\'It is not a question of how you think of it, Mr Fortescue. I\'m speaking about a fact.\'\n\n\'Yes. But really, Inspector, I don\'t see what you\'re trying to say...\' Percival broke off.\n\n\'Oh, I\'m not trying to say anything, Mr Fortescue,\' said Neele. \'I just like getting my facts together. Now, you said that you hadn\'t had any communication at all with your brother since he left England many years ago - but last spring you wrote and told him you were worried about your father\'s behaviour. You wanted your brother to support you in getting your father medically examined.\'\n\n\'I - I - I thought it only right. After all, Lance was a junior partner.\'\n\nInspector Neele looked at Lance, who was smiling.\n\n\'You received that letter?\' Inspector Neele asked.\n\nLance Fortescue nodded.\n\n\'What did you reply to it?\'\n\n\'I told Percy to leave the old man alone. I said the old man knew what he was doing. And that is one of the reasons why, when I got a letter from my father, I came home to see for myself. In the short interview I had with my father, he appeared to me to be quite capable of managing his business. Anyway, after I got back to Africa and had talked things over with Pat, I decided that I would come home and make sure that my father wasn\'t pushed into something that he didn\'t want.\' He looked at Percival as he spoke.\n\n\'I object strongly to what you are suggesting. I was worried about my father\'s health. I admit that I was also worried...\' Percival paused.\n\nLance filled the pause quickly. \'Worried about your pocket, eh?\' He got up and all of a sudden his behaviour changed. \'All right, Percy, I was going to annoy you for a while by pretending to work here, but I\'ve had enough of it. It makes me sick to be in the same room with you. You\'ve always been nasty and mean since you were a child, lying and making trouble. I\'ve always believed it was you who forged that cheque - for one thing it was a very bad forgery. I can\'t understand why Father didn\'t realize that if I had forged his name, I would have done it much better. Well, I\'m sick of little men like you with their almost criminal financial deals. We\'ll divide everything as you suggested, and I\'ll get back with Pat to a country where there\'s room to breathe. Give me Father\'s latest risky investments. I\'ll bet that one or two of them will make a great deal of money in the end! As for you, you little...\' Lance walked towards his brother, who stepped backwards quickly.\n\n\'All right,\' said Lance, \'I\'m not going to touch you. You wanted me out of here, you\'re getting me out of here.\' He added as he walked towards the door, \'You can also give me the old Blackbird Mine too, if you like. If we\'ve got murdering MacKenzies following us, I\'ll lead them off to Africa. Revenge - after all these years - it doesn\'t seem likely. But Inspector Neele seems to take it seriously, don\'t you, Inspector?\'\n\n\'Nonsense,\' said Percival. \'Such a thing is impossible!\'\n\nGently stroking his upper lip, Inspector Neele said, \'You remember the blackbirds last summer, Mr Fortescue. There are reasons for us to investigate.\'\n\n\'Nonsense,\' said Percival again. \'Nobody\'s heard of the MacKenzies for years.\'\n\n\'And yet,\' said Lance, \'I\'d almost believe that there\'s a MacKenzie very near us. I imagine the Inspector thinks so, too.\'\n\n***\n\nInspector Neele followed Lance Fortescue into the street. \'Mr Fortescue, when you came into the inner office and saw me, you were surprised. Why?\'\n\n\'Because I thought I\'d find Percy there. Miss Griffith said he was in his office.\'\n\n\'I see - so nobody knew he\'d gone out. There\'s no second door out of the inner office - but there is a door leading straight into the corridor from the secretary\'s office - I suppose your brother went out that way.\'\n\nLance looked at him. \'What\'s the idea, Inspector?\'\n\n\'Just puzzling over a few little things, that\'s all, Mr Fortescue.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 30856, 11701),
(30859, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie\n\nPart 12\n\nOn the train on the way back down to Baydon Heath, Inspector Neele read the news in The Times with only half his brain taking it in. He read of an earthquake in Japan; of the discovery in Tanganyika of valuable uranium, needed to make nuclear weapons; of the body of a sailor found on the beach near Southampton. All these items made a strange kind of pattern in the back of his mind and when he reached Yewtree Lodge he had made a decision. He said to Sergeant Hay, \'Where\'s Miss Marple? I\'d like to see her.\'\n\nMiss Marple arrived a few minutes later, looking quite pink. \'You want to see me, Inspector Neele? I do hope I haven\'t kept you waiting. I was in the kitchen talking to Mrs Crump about her wonderful cooking.\'\n\n\'What you really wanted to talk to her about,\' said Inspector Neele, \'was Gladys Martin?\'\n\nMiss Marple nodded. \'Yes. Gladys. You see, Mrs Crump was able to tell me about her behaviour lately and the things she said. I really think, you know, that things are becoming very much clearer, don\'t you?\'\n\n\'I do and I don\'t. Look here, Miss Marple, I\'ve heard something about you at the Yard.\' He smiled, \'It seems you\'re fairly well known there.\'\n\n\'I don\'t know how it is,\' said Miss Marple, \'but I so often seem to get mixed up in crimes and strange events.\'\n\n\'You\'ve got a reputation.\' said Inspector Neele, \'and you and I have different points of view. But our base is the same. This murder benefits certain people. One person in particular. The second murder benefits the same person. But the third murder - well, you could say the third murder was done to keep the murderer safe.\'\n\n\'But which do you call the third murder?\' Miss Marple asked. Her eyes, a very bright blue, looked intelligently at the Inspector. He nodded. \'Yes. When the Assistant Comissioner was speaking to me of these murders, something that he said seemed to me to be wrong. That was it. The nursery rhyme says: the king in his counting house, the queen in the parlour and the maid hanging out the clothes.\'\n\n\'Exactly,\' said Miss Marple. \'But actually Gladys must have been murdered before Mrs Fortescue, mustn\'t she?\'\n\n\'I think so,\' said Neele. \'Her body wasn\'t discovered till late that night, but she must almost certainly have been murdered round about five o\'clock, because otherwise she would have taken the second tray into the drawing room. She took one tray in with the tea on it, and then she saw or heard something. It might have been Dubois coming down the stairs from Mrs Fortescue\'s room. It might have been Gerald Wright coming in at the side door. Whoever it was persuaded her to leave the tea tray and go out into the garden. And once that had happened I believe she was killed immediately.\'\n\n\'You\'re quite right,\' said Miss Marple. \'It was never a case of \"the maid was in the garden hanging up the clothes\". She wouldn\'t be hanging up clothes at that time of the evening and the clothes peg was simply to make the thing fit in with the rhyme.\'\n\n\'It fits,\' said Neele, \'but I\'m going to describe my side of the case now, Miss Marple. I\'m going by the simple facts and the reasons for which sane people do murders. First, the death of Rex Fortescue, and who benefits by his death. Well, most of all, Percival. If a hundred thousand pounds had to be paid to Adele Fortescue according to her husband\'s will, Consolidated would have been finished as a business. But she didn\'t live longer than a month after her husband\'s death and the person who gained from her death was Percival Fortescue again. But although he could have put the taxine into the marmalade, he couldn\'t have poisoned his stepmother or strangled Gladys. According to his secretary he was in his city office at five o\'clock that afternoon, and he didn\'t arrive back here until nearly seven. However, there are other people who had a perfectly good motive.\'\n\n\'Mr Dubois, of course,\' said Miss Marple. \'And that young Mr Wright. Whenever there is any question of gain, one has to be very suspicious. Never trust anyone.\'\n\nNeele smiled. Miss Marple never failed to surprise him! \'Always think the worst, eh?\' he asked.\n\n\'Oh yes,\' said Miss Marple. \'Always!\'\n\n\'All right,\' said Neele, \'let\'s think the worst. Dubois could have done it, Gerald Wright could have done it if he had been working together with Elaine Fortescue and she put the taxine in the marmalade. Jennifer Fortescue could have done it, but none of them seem to have any connection with blackbirds and pockets full of rye. That\'s your theory and it points to one person. Mrs MacKenzie\'s in a mental hospital and her son Donald was killed in the war. That leaves the daughter, Ruby MacKenzie. And if your theory is correct, if this whole series of murders is because of the old Blackbird Mine business, then Ruby MacKenzie must be here in this house, and there\'s only one person that Ruby MacKenzie could be.\'\n\n\'I think, you know,\' said Miss Marple, \'that you may not be seeing the whole picture, Inspector.\'\n\nInspector Neele paid no attention. \'Just one person,\' he said. He got up and went out of the room.\n\n***\n\nMary Dove was in her sitting room. How wonderfully self- controlled the girl was, Neele thought. She said calmly, \'Yes, Inspector? What can I do for you?\'\n\nInspector Neele said quietly, \'Is your real name Dove?\'\n\nMary raised her eyebrows. \'Are you suggesting that my name is not Mary Dove?\'\n\n\'I\'m suggesting that your name is Ruby MacKenzie. Is your name Ruby MacKenzie?\'\n\n\'I have told you my name is Mary Dove. Do you want to see my birth certificate?\'\n\n\'You might have the birth certificate of a Mary Dove. That Mary Dove might be a friend of yours or might be someone who had died.\'\n\n\'Yes, there are a lot of possibilities, aren\'t there?\' There was laughter now in Mary Dove\'s voice. \'I think you know, Inspector, that you have to prove I am this Ruby MacKenzie, whoever she is.\' Looking him straight in the eyes, Mary Dove said, \'Yes, Inspector. Prove that I\'m Ruby MacKenzie, if you can.\'\n\n \n\nMiss Marple was talking to Jennifer Fortescue while she knitted. \'I had such a nice nurse looking after me when I once broke my wrist. She went on from me to nurse Mrs Sparrow\'s son, a very nice young naval officer and they married and had two dear little children. That was the beginning of your romance, was it not? I mean, you came here to nurse Mr Percival Fortescue, did you not? One should not listen to servants\' gossip, of course, but I\'m afraid an old lady like myself is always interested to hear about the people in the house. There was another nurse at first, was there not, and she got sent away - something like that? They said she was careless, I believe.\'\n\n\'I don\'t think she was careless,\' said Jennifer. \'I believe her father was extremely ill, and so I came to replace her.\'\n\n\'I see,\' said Miss Marple. \'And you fell in love with Percival and that was that. Yes, very nice indeed, very nice.\'\n\n\'I\'m not so sure about that,\' said Jennifer Fortescue. \'I often wish...\' her voice was very quiet, \'I was back in the hospital again. Life\'s so boring, you know. Oh, it\'s what I deserve! I should not have done it.\'\n\n\'Should not have done what, my dear?\'\n\n\'I should not have married Percival. Oh, well,\' she sighed. \'Don\'t let\'s talk of it any more.\'\n\nAnd Miss Marple began to talk about the new skirts that were being worn in Paris.\n\n***\n\nMiss Marple knocked at the door of the study and Inspector Neele told her to come in.\n\n\'We didn\'t really finish our talk just now,\' she said, \'and I wasn\'t quite ready then to make any accusation unless I was absolutely sure about it. And I am sure, now.\'\n\n\'You\'re sure about what, Miss Marple?\'\n\n\'Well, certainly about who killed Mr Fortescue. The marmalade shows how, as well as who, and though she was not clever, she was intelligent enough to do it. The beginning is Gladys. And what with the nylon stockings and the telephone calls and one thing and another, it was perfectly clear as to who put the Taxine into Mr Fortescue\'s marmalade.\'\n\n\'You have a theory?\' asked Inspector Neele.\n\n\'It isn\'t a theory,\' said Miss Marple. \'I know.\'\n\nInspector Neele looked surprised.\n\n\'It was Gladys, of course,\' said Miss Marple.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30858, 11701);

(30861, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie\n\nPart 13\n\n\'Are you saying,\' Inspector Neele said, astonished, \'that Gladys Martin deliberately murdered Rex Fortescue?\'\n\n\'No, of course she didn\'t mean to murder him,\' said Miss Marple, \'but she put the Taxine in the marmalade. She didn\'t think it was poison, of course.\'\n\n\'What did she think it was?\'\n\n\'I believe she thought it was a truth drug,\' said Miss Marple. \'It\'s very interesting, you know, the things these girls cut out of papers and keep, because they believe that if a story is in a newspaper, then it must be true. And if she had it read in the papers, then Gladys would have believed it when he told her that it was a truth drug.\'\n\n\'When who told her?\' said Inspector Neele.\n\n\'Albert Evans,\' said Miss Marple. \'That\'s not his real name, of course. He met her last summer at a holiday camp, and he said sweet things to her, kissed her, and probably told her some story of being cheated out of money by Rex Fortescue. The point was that Rex Fortescue had to be made to confess what he had done. I don\'t know this, of course, Inspector Neele, but I\'m quite sure about it. He persuaded her to take a job here - it\'s really very easy nowadays with the shortage of domestic staff, to get a job where you want one. They then arranged a date together. You remember on that last postcard he said, Remember our date. That was to be the day Gladys would put the drug that he gave her into the top of the marmalade, so that Mr Fortescue would eat it at breakfast, and she would also put the rye in his pocket. I don\'t know what story he told her to explain the rye, but Gladys Martin was a girl who would believe almost anything.\'\n\n\'Please continue,\' said Inspector Neele in an amazed voice.\n\n\'The idea probably was that Albert was going to visit him at the office that day, and that by that time the truth drug would have worked, and so Mr Fortescue would confess everything. You can imagine the poor girl\'s feelings when she heard that Mr Fortescue was dead.\'\n\n\'But, surely,\' Inspector Neele objected, \'she would have told someone?\'\n\n\'What was the first thing she said to you when you questioned her?\'\n\n\'She said, \"I didn\'t do it\",\' Inspector Neele said.\n\n\'Exactly,\' said Miss Marple. \'When she worked for me, Gladys would always say if she broke anything, \"I didn\'t do it, Miss Marple. I can\'t think how it happened.\" You don\'t think that a nervous young woman who had murdered someone when she didn\'t mean to murder him, is going to admit it, do you? Her first idea would be to deny it all. Then in a confused way she would try to sort it all out. Perhaps Albert hadn\'t known how strong the truth drug was. She\'d think of excuses for him. She would hope he would contact her, which he did. By telephone. There were unexplained calls that day. People rang up and, when Crump or Mrs Crump answered, nobody spoke, so they would put the telephone down. That\'s what he would do, you know. Ring up and wait until Gladys answered the phone, and then he would make an appointment with her to meet him.\'\n\n\'You mean she had an appointment to meet him on the day she died.\'\n\nMiss Marple nodded quickly. \'Yes. The girl was wearing her best nylon stockings and her good shoes. Only she wasn\'t going out to meet him. He was coming to Yewtree Lodge. That\'s why she was so excited and late with tea. Then, as she brought the second tray into the hall, she looked along the hall to the side door, and saw him there, waving to her. She put the tray down and went out to meet him.\'\n\n\'And then he strangled her,\' said Neele.\n\n\'He couldn\'t risk her talking. She had to die, poor, silly girl. And then - he put a clothes peg on her nose!\' There was great anger in the old lady\'s voice. \'To make it fit in with the rhyme. The rye, the blackbirds, the counting house, the bread and honey, and the clothes peg - the nearest he could get to a little dickey bird that nipped off her nose -\'\n\nAnd I suppose at the end of it all he\'ll go to Broadmoor and we won\'t be able to hang him because he\'s crazy!\' said Neele slowly.\n\n\'I think you\'ll hang him all right,\' said Miss Marple. \'He\'s not crazy, Inspector!\'\n\nInspector Neele looked hard at her. \'Now see here, Miss Marple, you\'re saying that a man is responsible for these crimes. A man who called himself Albert Evans was someone who wanted revenge for the old Blackbird Mine business. You\'re suggesting, aren\'t you, that Mrs MacKenzie\'s son, Don MacKenzie, didn\'t die in France. That he is responsible for all this?\'\n\n\'Oh no!\' she said. \'This blackbird business is a complete fake. It was used, that was all, by somebody who heard about the blackbirds on the desk and in the pie. The blackbirds were real enough. They were put there by someone who knew about the old business, who wanted revenge for it. But only the revenge of trying to frighten Mr Fortescue. I don\'t believe that children can really be brought up to carry out revenge. But someone whose father had been cheated and perhaps left to die, might want to play a trick on the person who was supposed to have done it. That\'s what happened, I think. And the killer used it.\'\n\n\'The killer,\' said Inspector Neele. \'Who was he?\'\n\n\'He\'s sane, brilliantly intelligent, and quite without morals. And he did it, of course, for money.\'\n\n\'Percival Fortescue?\' Inspector Neele almost begged, but he knew as he spoke that he was wrong.\n\n\'Oh, no,\' said Miss Marple. \'Not Percival. Lance.\'\n\nMiss Marple leaned forward in her chair. \'He\'s always been bad, completely bad, although he\'s also always been attractive. Especially attractive to women. And because of his charm, people have always believed the best about him. He came home in the summer to see his father. I don\'t believe for a moment that his father invited him - he probably flew over here and tried to get his father to forgive him, but Mr Fortescue wouldn\'t do it. You see, Lance was very much in love with Pat - who is a dear girl - and he wanted a respectable life with her. And that meant having a lot of money.\n\n\'When he was at Yewtree Lodge, he must have heard about these blackbirds. He guessed that MacKenzie\'s daughter was in the house and he realized that she would make a very good scapegoat for murder. Because when he couldn\'t get his father to do what he wanted, he cold-bloodedly decided that murder it would have to be. Perhaps the coincidence of his father\'s first name being Rex, together with hearing about the blackbirds in the pie, suggested the idea of the nursery rhyme. Then he could make a crazy business of the whole thing - and connect it to that old revenge threat of the MacKenzies. Then, you see, he could kill Adele, too, and stop that hundred thousand pounds going out of the firm. But there would have to be a third character, the \"maid in the garden hanging up the clothes\". An innocent accomplice whom he could silence before she could talk. And that would give him a real alibi for the first murder.\n\n\'He arrived here just before five o\'clock, which was the time Gladys brought the second tray into the hall. He came to the side door and waved to her. It would only have taken him three or four minutes to strangle her and carry her body to where the clothes lines were. Then he rang the front-door bell and joined the family for tea. After tea he went up to see Miss Ramsbottom. When he came down, he went into the drawing room, found Adele alone, drinking a last cup of tea, and sat down by her on the sofa. While he was talking to her, he managed to put the cyanide into her tea without her noticing.\'\n\nInspector Neele said slowly, \'But I cannot see what he thought he would get from it. Of course, unless old Fortescue died, the business would soon be finished, but is Lance\'s share really big enough to make him plan three murders?\'\n\n\'That is a little difficult,\' admitted Miss Marple. \'But is it really true that the Blackbird Mine is worthless?\'\n\nNeele thought about it. A gold mine. A worthless gold mine. And where was the mine? West Africa, Lance had said. But Miss Ramsbottom had said it was in East Africa. Lance had just come from East Africa. Maybe he had some recent knowledge?\n\nSuddenly another piece fitted into the Inspector\'s puzzle. Sitting in the train, reading The Times. Uranium deposits found in Tanganyika. What if the uranium was in the Blackbird Mine? Lance was there when it was found - and knew the mine was now worth a fortune. An enormous fortune! Neele sighed and looked at Miss Marple. \'How do you think,\' he asked, \'that I\'m ever going to be able to prove all this?\'\n\nMiss Marple nodded at him encouragingly. \'You\'ll prove it,\' she said. \'You\'re a very, very clever man, Inspector Neele. Now you know who it is, you ought to be able to get the evidence. At that holiday camp they\'ll recognize Lance\'s photograph. He must have gone there when he came over to see his father, looking for an innocent, vulnerable girl who would do anything for him. He\'ll find it hard to explain why he stayed there for a week, calling himself Albert Evans.\'\n\n\'Yes,\' Inspector Neele thought, \'I\'ll get him!\' Then, suddenly feeling unsure, he looked at Miss Marple. \'It\'s all theory, you know.\'\n\n\'Yes - but you are sure, aren\'t you?\'\n\n\'I suppose so. After all, I\'ve known people like him before.\'\n\nThe old lady nodded. \'Yes - that\'s really why I\'m sure.\'\n\n\'Because of your knowledge of criminals,\' Neele asked.\n\n\'Oh no - of course not. Because of Pat - a dear girl - and the kind that always marries a bad man - that\'s really what made me suspect him at the start.\'\n\n\'But there\'s a lot that needs explaining,\' said the Inspector. \'The Ruby MacKenzie business for instance. I could swear that...\'\n\nMiss Marple interrupted, \'Go and talk to Jennifer.\'\n\n***\n\n\'Mrs Fortescue,\' said Inspector Neele, \'do you mind telling me your name before you were married.\'\n\n\'Oh!\' Jennifer exclaimed. \'It - it was MacKenzie...\'\n\n\'You needn\'t be nervous, Madam,\' said Inspector Neele gently, and added, \'I was talking to your mother a few days ago at Pinewood Sanatorium.\'\n\n\'She\'s very angry with me,\' said Jennifer. \'Poor Mother, she loved Dad so much. She kept making us promise that we would kill Rex Fortescue one day. Of course, once I\'d started my nursing training, I began to realize that her mental balance wasn\'t what it should be.\'\n\n\'You yourself must have wanted revenge though, Mrs Fortescue?\'\n\n\'Well, of course I did. Rex Fortescue practically murdered my father! I\'m quite certain that he left Father to die. So I did want to pay him back. When a friend of mine came to nurse his son,\n\nPercival, I persuaded her to leave and suggested that I replace her. I don\'t know exactly what I meant to do. I had some idea, I think, of nursing his son so badly that he would die. But of course, if you are a nurse, you can\'t do that sort of thing. Actually I had great difficulty saving Percival. And then he asked me to marry him and I thought, \"Well, that\'s a far more sensible revenge than anything else.\" I mean, to marry Mr Fortescue\'s eldest son and get the money he cheated Father out of that way.\'\n\n\'Yes, indeed,\' said Inspector Neele, \'far more sensible. It was you, I suppose, who put the blackbirds on the desk and in the pie?\' Jennifer looked down. \'Yes. I suppose it was silly of me really... But I didn\'t do anything else.\'\n\n\'You don\'t - you don\'t honestly think I would murder anyone, do you?\'\n\nInspector Neele smiled. \'No,\' he said, \'I don\'t.\' He added, \'By the way, have you given Miss Dove any money lately?\'\n\nJennifer looked shocked. \'How did you know?\'\n\n\'We know a lot of things,\' said Inspector Neele and added to himself: And guess a good many, too.\n\n\'She came to me and said that you had accused her of being Ruby MacKenzie. She said if I gave her five hundred pounds, she would let you continue thinking she was Ruby MacKenzie.\n\nI found it very difficult to get the money. I had to sell a very beautiful necklace my husband had given me.\'\n\n\'Don\'t worry, Mrs Fortescue,\' said Inspector Neele, \'I think we can get your money back for you.\'\n\n***\n\nInspector Neele had another interview with Miss Mary Dove. \'I wonder, Miss Dove,\' he said, \'if you would give me a cheque for five hundred pounds payable to Mrs Jennifer Fortescue.\' He had the pleasure of seeing Mary Dove\'s calmness disappear.\n\n\'The silly fool told you, I suppose,\' she said.\n\n\'Yes. Blackmail. Miss Dove, is rather a serious crime.\'\n\n\'I think you\'d find it hard to prove that I was guilty of blackmail.\'\n\n\'Well, if you\'ll give me that cheque, Miss Dove, we\'ll leave it like that. Otherwise we have no proof against you at all. It is a strange, though, that in each of the last three places you have worked, there have been robberies about three months after you left. The thieves seemed to have known exactly where fur coats, jewels, etc. were kept. Strange coincidence, isn\'t it?\'\n\n\'Coincidences do happen, Inspector.\'\n\n\'Oh, yes,\' said Neele. \'But they mustn\'t happen too often, Miss Dove. It is possible,\' he added, \'that we may meet again in the future.\'\n\n\'I hope...\' said Mary Dove, \'I don\'t mean to be rude, Inspector Neele - but I hope we don\'t.\'\n\nMiss Marple went to say goodbye to Miss Ramsbottom. \'I\'m afraid,\' said Miss Marple, \'that I\'ve repaid you badly for your kindness to me.\'\n\n\'Hah,\' said Miss Ramsbottom. \'You found out what you wanted to, I suppose. And I suppose you\'ve told that police Inspector all about it? Will he be able to prove a case?\'\n\n\'I\'m almost sure he will,\' said Miss Marple. \'It may take a little time.\'\n\n\'I don\'t blame you for what you\'ve done. Wickedness is wickedness and has got to be punished. Handsome, Lance is, but he has always been bad. Yes, I was afraid of it. Ah, well, sometimes it can be difficult not to love a bad boy. The boy always had charm. He lied about the time he left me that day Adele died. But he was my beloved sister Elvira\'s boy - I couldn\'t possibly say anything against him. You\'re a good woman, Jane Marple, and good must always win. I\'m sorry for his wife, though.\'\n\n\'So am I,\' said Miss Marple.\n\n***\n\nIn the hall Pat Fortescue was waiting to say goodbye. \'I wish you weren\'t going,\' she said. \'I shall miss you.\'\n\n\'It\'s time for me to go,\' said Miss Marple. \'I\'ve finished what I came here to do. It\'s important, you know, that wickedness shouldn\'t win.\'\n\nPat looked puzzled. \'I don\'t understand.\'\n\n\'No, my dear. But if I might advise you, if anything ever goes wrong in your life - go back to where you were happy as a child. Go back to Ireland, my dear. Horses and dogs. All that.\'\n\nPat nodded. \'Sometimes I wish I had done just that when Freddy died. But if I had,\' her voice softened, \'I would not have met Lance. We\'re not staying here, you know. We\'re going back to East Africa. I\'m so pleased.\'\n\n\'Be happy, dear child,\' said Miss Marple. \'One needs a great deal of courage to get through life. I think you have it.\' She patted the girl\'s hand and went through the front door to the waiting taxi.\n\n***\n\nMiss Marple reached home late that evening. Kitty - the latest girl she had taken in to train - greeted her with a smiling face. \'I\'m so happy to see you - you\'ll find everything very nice in the house. I\'ve cleaned and cleaned!\'\n\n\'That\'s very nice, Kitty - I\'m happy to be home.\' There were six spider\'s webs on the ceiling, Miss Marple noted. These girls never looked up. She was too kind to say anything.\n\n\'Your letters are on the hall table, Miss. And there\'s one that was delivered to the wrong house - it only arrived today.\'\n\nMiss Marple recognized the childish handwriting. She tore the envelope open.\n\nDear Madam,\n\nI hope you\'ll forgive me writing this but I really don\'t know what to do and I never meant any harm. It was murder, they say, but it wasn\'t me that did it, not really. I would never do anything wicked like that and I know he wouldn\'t either. Albert, I mean.\n\nWe met last summer and we were going to be married, but Albert had been cheated out of his inheritance by Mr Rex Fortescue. And Mr Fortescue just denied everything and everybody believed him, and not Albert, because he was rich and Albert was poor. But Albert has a friend who works in a place where they make these new drugs and they have what they call a truth drug and it makes people speak the truth whether they want to or not.\n\nAlbert was going to see Mr Fortescue in his office on Nov. 5th, taking a lawyer with him. The only thing I had to do was to give Mr Fortescue the drug at breakfast that morning and then it would work just when they arrived and he\'d admit that everything that Albert said was quite true. Well, Madam, I put the drug in the marmalade - but now Mr Fortescue is dead! I think it must have been too strong, but it wasn\'t Albert\'s fault because Albert would never do a thing like that. I can\'t tell the police because maybe they\'d think Albert did it on purpose, which I know he didn\'t.\n\nOh, Madam, I don\'t know what to do and I haven\'t heard from Albert. If you could only come here and help me, they\'d listen to you. You were always so kind to me, and I didn\'t mean to do anything wrong and Albert didn\'t either. If you could only help us. Yours respectfully,\n\nGladys Martin.\n\nP. S. - I\'m enclosing a photograph of Albert and me. One of the boys took it at the holiday camp and gave it to me. Albert doesn\'t know I\'ve got it - he hates being photographed. But you can see, Madam, what a nice boy he is.\n\nMiss Marple stared down at the photograph, to the dark, handsome, smiling face of Lance Fortescue. The last words of the sad little letter echoed in her mind, You can see what a nice boy he is.\n\nTears rose in Miss Marple\'s eyes. But following her sadness for poor Gladys, there came anger - anger against a cold-blooded killer.\n\nAnd then there came a huge feeling of triumph - there was no escape now for Lance Fortescue!\n\n- THE END -', 1, 1, 0, '', 30860, 11701),
(30863, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 1\n\nA Journey for Tom Ripley\n\nTom looked behind him and saw the man coming out of the Green Cage. He walked faster. There was no doubt the man was following him. Tom had noticed him five minutes ago, staring at him from a table. Tom had paid for his drink in a hurry and left.\n\nAt the corner, Tom leaned forward and ran across Fifth Avenue. There was Raoul\'s. Should he take a chance and go in for another drink? Or should he run over to Park Avenue and try to escape by hiding in dark doorways? He went into Raoul\'s.\n\nAs he walked up to an empty seat at the bar, he looked around to see if he knew anyone. There was that big man with red hair, whose name he always forgot, sitting at a table with a blonde girl. But who was that man outside? Was that the kind of man they would send after him? He didn\'t look like a police officer or a detective. He looked like a businessman, someone\'s father, well-dressed with gray hair. Was that the kind of man they sent on a job like this? He would chat with you in a bar, and then bang! - one hand on the shoulder and the other hand holding a policeman\'s identification. Tom Ripley, you\'re under arrest! Tom watched the door.\n\nHere he was, coming inside, taking a place at the bar. Tom stared at him. They couldn\'t give you more than ten years, Tom thought. Maybe fifteen, but with good behavior - As the man started to speak, Tom suffered a moment of desperate regret. Why was he pretending to work for the income tax office? Yes, he received checks for hundreds of dollars from stupid people who believed him when he said they owed money. But he never cashed the checks. It was really just a silly game that made him feel powerful.\n\n\"Pardon me, are you Tom Ripley?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"My name is Herbert Greenleaf. Richard Greenleaf\'s father.\" The look on his face would have been less confusing if he had been holding a gun. The face was friendly, smiling, and hopeful. \"You\'re a friend of Richard\'s, aren\'t you?\"\n\nTom searched his memory. Dickie Greenleaf. A tall, blond guy. He had quite a lot of money, Tom remembered. \"Oh, Dickie Greenleaf, yes.\"\n\n\"Charles and Marta Schriever told me about you. I know so few of Richard\'s friends, but they seemed to think you know him quite well. Somebody told them you drank at the Green Cage.\"\n\n\"I remember him, yes.\"\n\n\"But you\'re not writing him now?\" Mr. Greenleaf seemed disappointed.\n\n\"No, I don\'t think I\'ve seen Dickie in a couple of years.\"\n\n\"He\'s been in Europe for two years. The Schrievers thought you might have some influence on Richard. We want him to come home.\"\n\nTom hadn\'t seen the Schrievers more than three or four times in his life. He had once calculated Charley Schrievers income tax and saved him a lot of money. Maybe that was why the Schrievers had recommended him. Maybe Charley had said that Tom was intelligent, honest, and very willing to help. It was a slight mistake.\n\n\"I don\'t suppose you know anybody else close to Richard who might be able to persuade him?\" Mr. Greenleaf asked.\n\n\"I\'d certainly like to help. Where is he staying in Europe?\" Tom asked, not caring at all where Dickie was staying.\n\n\"In a town called Mongibello, south of Naples. He divides his time between painting and sailing. He bought a house. Richard has his own income - not a large amount, but enough to live on in Italy it seems.\"\n\nTom thought Dickie was probably having a great time over there. An income, a house, a boat. Why should he want to come home? Dickie was lucky. What was Tom doing? Living from week to week. Hiding from the police now for the first time in his life. He had a talent for mathematics. Why didn\'t someone pay him for it? Tom realized that his whole body had tensed. He was bored, bored, bored! He wanted to be at the bar by himself.\n\n\"I\'d be very happy to write to Dickie if you give me his address. I suppose he\'ll remember me. We were at a weekend party out on Long Island once, I remember. And I came up to your apartment a few times, too,\" Tom went on. \"He showed me some of his models - of ships.\"\n\n\"Did he ever show you his drawings?\" Mr. Greenleaf was smiling again.\n\nDickie hadn\'t, but Tom said brightly, \"Yes, of course he did. Interesting, some of them.\" Tom had never seen them, but he could imagine them now - and he could see Dickie holding them up for him to see.\n\n\"Yes, Richard has talent,\" Mr. Greenleaf said with satisfaction.\n\n\"I think he has,\" Tom agreed. He was getting more bored every minute. He knew the feelings. He experienced them at parties or when he was having dinner with somebody he didn\'t want to be with. \"I\'m sorry I\'m not free now or I\'d go over and try to persuade Richard myself,\" Tom said, just because Mr. Greenleaf wanted him to.\n\n\"Richard has always listened to his friends\' advice. If you or somebody else could find the time, I\'d even send them over to talk to him. I don\'t suppose you could get time off from your present job, could you? \"\n\nTom\'s heart suddenly jumped. He put a look of careful thought on his face. He didn\'t have a job. He might have to leave town soon anyway if the police started asking questions. He wanted to leave New York. \"I might,\" he said carefully.\n\n\"I\'d be glad to pay for your trip. Do you really think you might be able to go - this fall?\"\n\n\"I think I might. I\'d be glad to see Richard again - especially if you think I might be able to help.\"\n\n\"I do! I think he\'d listen to you. You\'ll probably succeed where the rest of us have failed. Why don\'t you come over to my house and meet my wife? We\'d be so happy if you would go to Europe and bring Richard back.\"\n\n***\n\n\"Hello, Tom, my boy!\" Mr. Greenleaf said in a voice that promised good drinks, an excellent dinner, and a bed for the night in case he got too tired to go home. \"Emily, this is Tom Ripley!\"\n\n\"I\'m so happy to meet you!\" his wife said warmly.\n\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Greenleaf?\"\n\n\"Mr. Ripley\'s been here before,\" Mr. Greenleaf said. \"He\'s come here with Richard.\"\n\n\"Oh, has he? I don\'t believe I met you, though.\"\n\nAbout thirty minutes later, they went into the dining-room, where a table was set for three with a dark blue tablecloth and a whole cold chicken.\n\nThe conversation was dull and the dinner delicious. Tom told Mrs. Greenleaf that he was working for an advertising company called Rothenberg, Fleming, and Barter. Later, on purpose, he called it Reddington, Fleming, and Parker. The Greenleafs didn\'t notice the difference.\n\n\"Where did you go to college?\" Mr. Greenleaf asked.\n\n\"I went to Princeton for a time, then when I visited an aunt in Denver I stayed out there and went to college.\" Tom hoped Mr. Greenleaf would ask him something about Princeton, but he didn\'t. Tom could discuss the teaching system, the college rules, the atmosphere at weekend dances, and the political beliefs of the students. He had been very friendly with a Princeton student last summer and had asked him for more and more information in case he might be able to use it some time. Tom had also met a young man who had been going to the University of Colorado. He had told the Greenleafs that he had been raised by his Aunt Dottie in Boston. In truth, though, she had taken him to Denver when he was sixteen, and he had only finished high school there, but he felt like he had gone to school there as well. After Tom had finished high school, they had moved back to Boston again.\n\nMrs. Greenleaf came in with some photographs and Tom sat down beside her as she looked through them. Richard taking his first step; Richard with long, blond curls. The photographs weren\'t interesting to him until Richard was about sixteen. Richard had hardly changed between sixteen and twenty-four.\n\nMrs. Greenleaf handed Tom several photos. \"These are from Europe. This is Mongibello,\" she said, showing Tom a picture of Dickie in a boat on the sand. \"And here\'s the girl, the only other American who lives there.\"\n\n\"Marge Sherwood,\" Mr. Greenleaf said. The girl was in a swimsuit on the beach, her arms around her knees. There was also a good picture of Richard in shorts, sitting on the wall of a terrace.\n\nTom noticed that Mrs. Greenleaf was staring down at the floor in front of her. He saw tears in her eyes. Mr. Greenleaf had told him that Mrs. Greenleaf was seriously ill and got emotional very easily. She was worried she would never see Dickie again. Her husband came over to comfort her.\n\n\"Mrs. Greenleaf,\" Tom said softly, \"I want you to know that I\'ll do everything I can to make Dickie come home.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Tom.\" She pressed Tom\'s hand tightly.\n\n\"Emily, don\'t you think it\'s time for you to go to bed?\" Mr. Greenleaf asked.\n\nTom stood up as Mrs. Greenleaf did. Mr. Greenleaf went out of the room with her.\n\nTom remained standing, his hands at his sides. In a large mirror on the wall he could see himself: the serious, hard-working young man again. He was doing the right thing, behaving the right way, but he had a feeling of guilt.\n\nHe felt himself beginning to sweat, and he tried to relax. What was he so worried about? He\'d felt so good tonight. It\'s like a dream, Tom thought. In a minute, Mr. Greenleaf or somebody else would say, \"Tom, Tom!\" and he would open his eyes and find himself back in Raoul\'s with a drink in front of him.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30862, 11701),
(30865, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 2\n\nA New Start\n\nTom\'s mood was calm and happy, but he didn\'t feel like making friends. He wanted his time for thinking. He began to play a role on the ship, the role of a serious young man with an important job ahead of him.\n\nHe had a sudden desire for a hat and so he bought one on the ship, a blue-gray cap of soft English wool. He could look like so many different types of people in the hat. He had always thought that he had the world\'s dullest face. The cap changed all that. Now he was a young man with a private income, not long out of Princeton, possibly.\n\nHe was starting a new life. Goodbye to all of the awful people he had known in New York. Whatever happened with Dickie, he would handle himself well and Mr. Greenleaf would respect him for it. When Mr. Greenleaf\'s money was gone, he might not come back to America. He might get an interesting job in a hotel. Or he might work as a salesperson for a European company and travel around in the world.\n\nOne afternoon, he wrote a polite letter to his Aunt Dottie.\n\n \n\nDear Auntie,\n\nI am on my way to Europe by boat. I had a business offer that I can\'t explain right now. I had to leave suddenly, so I was not able to come to Boston and I\'m sorry because it may be months or even years before I come back.\n\nI wanted to tell you not to worry and not to send me any more checks. Thank you very much for the last one from a month ago. I am well and very happy.\n\nLove, Tom\n\n \n\nThe letter made him feel better because it separated him from her. No more of the letters comparing him to his father and the stupid checks for six dollars and forty-eight cents or twelve dollars and ninety-five cents when she had some change left over from the store. Aunt Dottie had always told Tom that he had cost her more than his father had left in insurance. But did she have to keep repeating it? Lots of aunts and even strangers raised a child for nothing and were glad to do it.\n\nAfter his letter to Aunt Dottie, he got up and walked around the ship. He always got angry when he wrote to her. He hated being nice to her. Until now he had always needed the money she sent him. But he didn\'t need it now. He would be independent forever.\n\nHe had run away from Aunt Dottie at seventeen and had been brought back, and he had done it again at twenty and succeeded. He remembered how innocent he had been, not knowing how the world worked. He remembered how he felt when he had been fired from a job in New York because he wasn\'t strong enough to lift boxes eight hours a day. He was very upset and thought it wasn\'t fair. He remembered deciding then that the world was full of selfish people and that you had to be an animal or you wouldn\'t eat. He remembered right after that, he had stolen a loaf of bread from a store and had taken it home and eaten it quickly, feeling that the world owed him bread, and more.\n\nTom sat back in his chair again, pulled his hat down over his eyes, and folded his hands over his stomach. His separation from the other passengers was making them notice him. He imagined the others asking, \"Is he an American? I think so, but he doesn\'t act like an American, does he? Most Americans are so noisy. He\'s very serious, isn\'t he, and he can\'t be more than twenty-three. He must have something very important on his mind.\"\n\nYes, he had. The present and future of Tom Ripley.\n\n***\n\nA few days later, Tom arrived in Naples, where he stayed overnight. The next morning at eleven, he got on the bus for Mongibello. Now and then he saw little villages by the water\'s edge and people swimming near the shore. Finally, the driver said loudly, \"Mongibello.\"\n\nTom jumped down out of the bus and walked into the little post office across the road, where he asked the man behind the window for Richard Greenleaf\'s house.\n\nAfter a short walk, Tom found a two-floor house with an iron gate on the road and a terrace that hung over the cliff\'s edge. Tom rang the bell. An Italian woman came out of the house drying her hands.\n\n\"Mr. Greenleaf?\" Tom asked.\n\nThe woman smiled and answered in Italian as she pointed down toward the sea.\n\nTom nodded. \"Thank you.\" He didn\'t have a swimsuit so he went into one of the little shops near the post office and bought a tiny black and yellow one. He put on his shoes again and walked down a road which led to the beach.\n\nLooking down the beach, Tom saw him from a great distance - definitely Dickie, though his skin was a dark brown and his hair looked lighter than Tom remembered it. He was with Marge. Tom approached the pair.\n\n\"Dickie Greenleaf?\" he asked, smiling.\n\nDickie looked up. \"Yes?\"\n\n\"I\'m Tom Ripley. I met you in the States several years ago. Remember? \"\n\nDickie didn\'t seem to recognize Tom.\n\n\"I think your father said he was going to write you about me.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes!\" Dickie said. He stood up. \"Tom what is it?\"\n\n\"Ripley.\"\n\n\"This is Marge Sherwood,\" he said. \"Marge, Tom Ripley.\" Dickie was looking at him carefully, not in a very friendly manner.\n\n\"You don\'t seem to remember me from New York,\" Tom said.\n\n\"I can\'t really say that I do,\" Dickie said, \"Where did I meet you?\"\n\n\"I think - Wasn\'t it at Buddy Lankenau\'s?\" It wasn\'t, but he knew Dickie knew Buddy Lankenau, and Buddy was a very nice guy.\n\nAfter a short swim, Dickie and Marge returned to their towels. Dickie said, \"We\'re leaving. Would you like to come up to the house and have lunch with us?\"\n\n\"Well, yes. Thanks very much.\"\n\nFifteen minutes later, Tom had had a cool shower and was sitting in a comfortable chair on Dickie\'s terrace with a drink in his hand. He wondered if Marge lived here.\n\nAt that moment, Dickie came out and poured himself a drink. \"Sorry there\'s no ice. I haven\'t got a refrigerator.\"\n\nTom smiled. \"I have a shirt for you. Your mother said you\'d asked for one. Also some socks.\"\n\n\"Do you know my mother?\"\n\n\"I met your father just before I left New York, and he asked me to dinner at his house.\"\n\n\"I suppose he offered you a job, too. He\'s always searching for young men to work for his company.\"\n\n\"No, he didn\'t.\" Tom felt that Dickie didn\'t like him. Had Mr. Greenleaf told Dickie he was coming to persuade him to return home? Or was Dickie just in a bad mood? He probably could have persuaded Dickie to come home if he had met Dickie in a cafe down at the beach, but this way was useless. Tom was angry at himself. Nothing he took so seriously ever worked out. He had learned that years ago.\n\n\"What hotel are you staying in?\" Marge asked Tom.\n\nTom smiled. \"I haven\'t found one yet. What do you recommend?\"\n\n\"The Miramare\'s the best.\"\n\n\"In that case, I\'ll try the Miramare,\" Tom said, standing up. \"I must go.\"\n\nNeither Dickie nor Marge asked him to stay. Dickie walked with him to the gate. Marge wasn\'t leaving. Tom wondered if Dickie and Marge were sleeping together. Marge was in love with Dickie, Tom thought, but Dickie didn\'t care much about her.\n\n\"It was nice to meet you. Goodbye, Dickie.\"\n\n\"Goodbye.\"\n\n***\n\nTom let three days go by. On the fourth morning, he went down to the beach and found Dickie alone.\n\n\"Doesn\'t look like Marge is coming down,\" Dickie said. \"I think I\'ll go up.\"\n\nTom got up. They walked to the Miramare, saying almost nothing to each other. They went up to Tom\'s room, and Dickie tried the shirt on and held the socks up to his feet. Both the shirt and the socks were the right size and, as Tom had thought, Dickie was very pleased with the shirt.\n\nNow Dickie had everything, Tom thought, everything he had to offer. He would refuse an invitation for a drink, too, Tom knew. \"Thanks for delivering the clothes. It was very nice of you.\" Dickie held out his hand.\n\n\"I think I ought to tell you something else,\" Tom said with a smile. \"Your father sent me over here especially to ask you to come home.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" Dickie asked. \"Paid your way?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" It was his last chance to make Dickie laugh or go out and slam the door in disgust. But the smile was coming the way Tom remembered Dickie\'s smile.\n\n\"Paid your way! He\'s getting desperate, isn\'t he?\" Dickie closed the door again.\n\n\"He came up to me in a bar in New York,\" Tom said. \"I told him I wasn\'t a close friend of yours, but he thought I could help if I came over. I told him I\'d try. I don\'t want you to think I\'m taking advantage of your father. I\'ll try to find a job somewhere in Europe soon, and I\'ll be able to pay him back. He bought me a round-trip ticket.\"\n\n\"Oh, don\'t bother! The company will pay for it. I can just see Dad approaching you in a bar. Which bar was it?\"\n\n\"Raonl\'s. He followed me from the Green Cage.\"\n\nTom and Dickie had a drink in the hotel bar. They drank to Herbert Richard Greenleaf.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30864, 11701),
(30867, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 3\n\nFriendships and Jealousies\n\n\"Come on, Tom, I\'ll show you some of my paintings.\"\n\nDickie led the way into the big room Tom had looked into a couple of times on his way to and from the shower.\n\n\"This is one of Marge I\'m working on now.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" Tom said with interest. It wasn\'t good in his opinion, probably in anybody\'s opinion.\n\n\"And these - a lot of paintings of the seashore. \"Dickie obviously wanted Tom to say something nice about them, because he was proud of them. They were all wild and all the same.\n\n\"How long are you going to be here?\" Dickie asked.\n\n\"Oh, at least a week, I think,\" Tom answered.\n\n\"Because - \" Dickie\'s face was red from the wine which had put him in a good mood. \"If you\'re going to be here a little longer, why don\'t you stay with me? There\'s no reason to stay in a hotel, unless you prefer it.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" Tom said.\n\n\"There\'s a bed in the other room, which you didn\'t see.\"\n\n***\n\nThe next morning, Tom moved in.\n\n\"Are we still going to Naples?\" Tom asked. \"Remember? We talked about it yesterday.\"\n\n\"Certainly.\" Dickie looked at his watch. \"It\'s only a quarter to twelve. We can make the twelve o\'clock bus.\"\n\nThe bus was just arriving as they reached the post office. Dickie stopped running, right in the face of a young man with red hair and a bright sports shirt, an American.\n\n\"Dickie!\"\n\n\"Freddie!\" Dickie yelled. \"What are you doing here?\"\n\n\"Came to see you! And the Cecchis. They\'re giving me a place to stay for a few days.\"\n\n\"I\'m off to Naples with a friend. Tom?\" Dickie introduced them.\n\nThe American\'s name was Freddie Miles. Tom thought he was disgusting. He hated red hair. Freddie had large red-brown eyes that shook in his head. He was also very heavy.\n\n\"See you tonight, Freddie.\"\n\nAbout an hour later, the bus left Tom and Dickie in Naples.\n\n\"I know a good place for lunch,\" Dickie said. \"A real Neapolitan pizza place. Do you like pizza?\"\n\nThey sat there until five o\'clock. Dickie had spent most of the time talking about Freddie, and Tom had found the conversation as uninteresting as Freddie\'s face. Then they moved to a cafe called the Galleria.\n\n\"This is what I like,\" Dickie said. \"Sitting at a table and watching the people go by. It really improves your attitude toward life.\"\n\nA well-dressed Italian greeted Dickie warmly and sat down at the table with them. Tom listened to their conversation in Italian, understanding a word here and there.\n\n\"Want to go to Rome?\" Dickie asked him suddenly.\n\n\"Sure,\" Tom said. \"Now?\"\n\nThe Italian had a long, gray car with a loud radio that he and Dickie seemed happy to shout over. They reached Rome in about two hours and the Italian dropped them in the middle of a street and said a quick goodbye.\n\nIn Rome, they bought tickets for a music show that evening. After the show, they had dinner and drank a bottle and a half of wine. They were in a fine mood by one in the morning. They walked with their arms around each other\'s shoulders, singing and talking. Neither had the slightest idea what street they were on.\n\n\"When the sun comes up, we can see where we are,\" Dickie said cheerfully. He looked at his watch. \"Only a couple more hours.\"\n\nThe next morning, they returned to Naples, just in time to catch the bus for Mongibello.\n\nWhen they reached Mongibello, Marge was annoyed because Dickie hadn\'t called to say he was spending the night in Rome.\n\n\"I don\'t mind, of course, but I thought you were in Naples, and anything can happen in Naples.\"\n\nTom kept his mouth shut. He wasn\'t going to tell Marge anything they had done. Let her imagine what she pleased. Dickie had made it clear that they had had a very good time. Marge had the look of a mother or an older sister now - the woman\'s dislike of the rough play of little boys and men. Or was it jealousy? She seemed to know that Dickie had formed a closer friendship with Tom in twenty-four hours, just because he was another man, than she could ever have with Dickie, whether he loved her or not, and he didn\'t.\n\n***\n\nFor the next three or four days, they didn\'t see much of Marge. Tom, anyway, kept Dickie amused. He had lots of funny stories to tell about New York, some of them true, some of them invented. Obviously, Dickie was enjoying his company.\n\nTom wrote to Mr. Greenleaf, promising him that Dickie was considering returning to the United States. He had to smile as he wrote the letter, because he and Dickie were talking of visiting the Greek islands this winter. Marge wouldn\'t be going,Tom was sure. Both he and Dickie left her out of their travel plans when they discussed them.\n\nDickie was paying attention to Marge because he knew she\'d be lonely in Mongibello by herself. But one day when they asked her to go to the Roman ruins at Herculaneum, she refused.\n\n\"I think I\'ll stay home. You boys enjoy yourselves,\" she said with an effort at a cheerful smile.\n\n\"Well, if she won\'t, she won\'t,\" Tom said, and then walked calmly into the house so that she and Dickie could talk alone on the terrace if they wanted to.\n\nAfter a few minutes, the gate slammed. Marge had left. Tom walked out of the house and onto the terrace.\n\n\"Was she angry about something?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"No. She feels kind of ignored, I suppose.\"\n\n\"I feel like I\'m getting in the way of your relationship with Marge.\"\n\n\"Of course not! Getting in the way of what?\"\n\n\"Well, she might think so.\"\n\n\"No. it\'s just that I owe her something. And I haven\'t been particularly nice to her lately. We haven\'t.\"\n\n\"It\'s after two. Want to take a little walk and go by the post office?\"\n\nThey walked down the hill in silence. What had Marge said about him, Tom wondered. Dickie came out of his silence only to greet Luigi, the post office worker, and thank him for his letter. Tom had no mail.\n\n\"I think I\'ll go up to see Marge,\" Dickie said. \"I won\'t be long, but don\'t wait.\"\n\n\"All right,\" Tom said, feeling suddenly desperate. About half way up the hill he had the sudden need to go to Marge\'s house. He could go with the excuse of apologizing to her, but satisfy his anger by surprising and annoying them. He suddenly felt that Dickie was touching her, at this minute, and partly he wanted to see it, and partly he hated the idea of seeing it.\n\nTom stopped near Marge\'s apartment. One of her bras was hanging out of the window. Through the window, he could see that Dickie\'s arm was around her waist. Dickie was kissing her, little kisses on her cheek, smiling at her. Tom was disgusted. He knew Dickie didn\'t mean it; he knew Dickie was using this cheap, easy way to hold on to her friendship.\n\nTom turned away and ran down the steps, wanting to scream. He ran all the way to Dickie\'s house and sat on the couch in Dickie\'s living room for a few moments, his mind shocked and empty.\n\nHe went into Dickie\'s bedroom and walked around for a few moments, his hands in his pockets. He wondered when Dickie was coming back. Or was he going to stay all afternoon, really take her to bed with him? He opened Dickie\'s closet door and looked in. There was a new-looking gray suit. Tom took it out. He took off his shorts and put on the gray pants. He put on a pair of Dickie\'s shoes. Then he opened the bottom drawer and took out a clean blue and white shirt.\n\n\"Marge, you must understand that I don\'t love you,\" Tom said into the mirror in Dickie\'s voice. \"Marge, stop it!\" Tom turned suddenly and made a move in the air pretending to grab Marge\'s throat. He shook her, twisted her down to the floor. He was breathing heavily. \"You know why I had to do that,\" he said, addressing Marge, though he watched himself in the mirror. \"You were coming between Tom and me - No, not that! But there is something between us!\"\n\nHe turned, stepped over the imaginary body, and went to the window. He could see the bottom of the steps that led up to Marge\'s house. Maybe they were sleeping together, Tom thought with disgust. He ran back to the closet and took a hat from the top shelf. He put it on. It surprised him how much he looked like Dickie with the top part of his head covered. Really it was only his darker hair that was very different from Dickie. But his nose, his narrow jaw, his eyes -\n\n\"What\'re you doing?\"\n\nTom turned around quickly. Dickie was in the doorway.\" Oh - just amusing myself. Sorry, Dickie.\"\n\nDickie slammed the door loudly. \"Please get out of my clothes.\"\n\n\"Are you and Marge OK?\" Tom tried to calm himself as he hung up the suit.\n\n\"Marge and I are fine,\" Dickie yelled. \"Another thing I want to say,\" he said, looking at Tom, \"I\'m not in love with you. I don\'t know if you have the idea that I am or not.\"\n\n\"In love with me?\" Tom smiled weakly.\" I never thought you were.\"\n\n\"Well, Marge thinks you\'re in love with me.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Tom felt the blood go out of his face. \"What have I ever done?\"\n\n\"It\'s just the way you act,\" Dickie said, and went out of the door.\n\nTom quickly put his shorts back on and followed Dickie. Just because Dickie liked him, Tom thought, Marge had spread her dirty ideas about him to Dickie. \"Are you in love with Marge?\"\n\n\"No, but I feel sorry for her. I care about her. She\'s been very nice to me. We\'ve had some good times together. You don\'t seem to be able to understand that. I\'m going to keep her friendship.\"\n\n\"Well, have I done anything to prevent you? I told you, Dickie, I\'d rather leave than do anything to hurt your friendship with Marge.\"\n\nDickie looked at Tom. \"No, you haven\'t done anything, specifically, but it\'s obvious you don\'t like her around.\"\n\n\"I\'m sorry,\" Tom said sincerely. He was sorry he hadn\'t made more of an effort, that he had done a bad job.\n\n\"Well, let\'s forget it. Marge and 1 are OK.\" Dickie turned away and stared out at the water.\n\nTom went into the kitchen to make himself some coffee. This wasn\'t the time to be too friendly with Dickie. Dickie had his pride. He would be silent for most of the afternoon, then come back in by about five o\'clock after he had been painting for a time, and everything would be the same as before. One thing Tom was sure of: Dickie was glad to have him here. Dickie was bored with living by himself, and bored with Marge, too. Tom still had three hundred dollars left, and he and Dickie were going to use it on a trip to Paris.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30866, 11701);

(30869, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 4\n\nA Loss of Control\nThe next day, Tom walked down to the post office. There were two letters, one to him from Dickie\'s father, one to Dickie from someone in New York who Tom didn\'t know. He walked quickly home as he opened Mr. Greenleaf\'s letter, unfolding the typewritten sheet respectfully.\n\nNov. 10,2019\nMy dear Tom,\nSince you have been with Dickie over a month and he shows no more sign of coming home than before you went, it is clear to me that you haven\'t been successful. I realize that you reported sincerely that he is considering returning, but honestly, I don\'t see it anywhere in his letter of October 26. He seems more determined than ever to stay where he is.\nI want you to know that my wife and I appreciate whatever efforts you have made for us. From today, I have no further need of your assistance. I hope you have not troubled yourself greatly by your efforts of the last month, and I sincerely hope the trip has given you some pleasure despite the failure of its main goal.\n\nBoth my wife and I send you greetings and our thanks.\n\nSincerely, H. R. Greenleaf\n\n\nTom walked into the house. It was the end. Mr. Greenleaf had simply fired him. He had failed. He stood at the corner of the terrace, staring out at the city and thinking of nothing, feeling lost and alone. He turned as he heard the gate open. Dickie walked up the path, smiling, but Tom thought it was an unnatural, polite smile.\n\"Here\'s a letter for you.\" He handed Dickie his letter and put the one from Mr. Greenleaf into his pocket.\n\nWhen Dickie had finished reading his letter - a letter that made him laugh out loud as he read it - Tom said, \"Do you think Marge would like to go up to Paris with us when we go? \"\nDickie looked surprised. \"I think she would.\"\n\"Well, ask her,\" Tom said cheerfully.\n\"I don\'t know if I should go up to Paris,\" Dickie said. \"I wouldn\'t mind getting away somewhere for a few days, but Paris -\" He lighted a cigarette. \"I\'d rather go to San Remo or even Genoa.\"\n\"But Paris - Genoa can\'t compare with Paris, can it?\"\n\"No, of course not, but it\'s a lot closer.\"\n\"But when will we get to Paris?\"\n\"I don\'t know. Any time. Paris\'ll still be there.\"\n\nTom ran from the hall into the kitchen and fixed himself an iceless drink. His hands were shaking. Only yesterday Dickie had said, \"Are you going home for Christmas?\" very quietly in the middle of a conversation, but Dickie knew he wasn\'t going home for Christmas. He didn\'t have a home and Dickie knew it. He had told Dickie all about Aunt Dottie in Boston. It was simply what Dickie wanted, that was all. Marge was full of plans for Christmas. He couldn\'t bear to imagine it. All right, he\'d leave.\nHe\'d do anything rather than spend Christmas with them.\n\n***\n\nMarge said she didn\'t care to go with them to San Remo. She was busy working on her book. The book must be awful, Tom thought. He had known writers. You didn\'t write a book while spending half the day on the beach.\nThey took only one suitcase of Dickie\'s for the two of them, because they planned to be away only three nights and four days. Dickie was in a slightly more cheerful mood, but the awful feeling was still there, the feeling that this was the last trip they would make together anywhere.\nDickie said absolutely nothing on the train to San Remo. Tom sat opposite him, staring at his handsome, expressionless face, at his hands with the two rings: one green and one gold. Tom decided to steal the green ring when he left. He would do it the very last day, he thought. He stared at Dickie\'s closed eyes. A crazy emotion of hate, of warmth, of impatience, and frustration was rising in him, preventing his breathing. He wanted to kill Dickie.\nIt was not the first time he had thought of it. Before, once or twice or three times, it had been a desire that went away immediately and left him with a feeling of shame. Now he thought about it for a whole minute, two minutes, because he was leaving Dickie anyway, and what was there to be ashamed of any more? He had offered Dickie friendship, and respect, everything he had to offer, and Dickie had answered with coldness and now dislike. Dickie was just pushing him out in the cold. If he killed him on this trip, Tom thought, he could simply say that there had been an accident. He could - He had just thought of something brilliant: he could become Dickie Greenleaf himself. He could do everything that Dickie did. He could go back to Mongibello first and collect Dickie\'s things, tell Marge a story, rent an apartment in Rome or Paris, receive Dickie\'s check every month, and sign Dickie\'s name on it. He could step right into Dickie\'s shoes. He began to think of how.\nThe water. But Dickie was such a good swimmer. The cliffs. It would be easy to push Dickie off a cliff when they took a walk, but he imagined Dickie grabbing at him and pulling him off with him, and he felt nervous. He would have to make his hair more blond. But he wouldn\'t live in a place, of course, where somebody who knew Dickie lived. He had only to look enough like Dickie to be able to use his passport.\nDickie opened his eyes, looking right at him, and Tom relaxed, putting his head back and shutting his eyes quickly.\n\"Tom, are you OK?\" Dickie asked, shaking Tom\'s knee.\n\"OK,\" Tom said, smiling a little. He saw Dickie sit back with a look of anger, and Tom knew why; because Dickie had hated giving him even that much attention. Tom smiled to himself, amused at pretending to be asleep. That had been the only way to hide his thoughts from Dickie.\nSan Remo. Flowers. A main street along the beach, shops and stores, and French, English, and Italian tourists. Tom searched his brain. Where? In one of these little streets tonight? In the water? It was slightly cloudy, though not cold. It would be easy in the hotel room, too, but how would he get rid of the body? That left only the water, and Dickie was very comfortable in the water. There were boats, rowboats and little motorboats, that people could rent down at the beach. In each motorboat, Tom noticed, was a heavy, round, cement anchor tied to a rope to prevent the boat from floating away.\n\"Why don\'t we take a boat, Dickie?\" Tom asked, trying not to sound eager.\n\"Well, all right. For an hour around the port,\" Dickie said.\nThe Italian boatman started the motor for them. Then Dickie took the wheel and they headed straight out from the town.\n\"Where\'re you going?\" Tom shouted.\n\"Does it matter?\" Dickie smiled.\nNo it didn\'t.\n\"You dare me to jump in?\" Tom asked, beginning to take off his jacket.\nDickie only laughed at this suggestion, opening his mouth wide, keeping his eyes fixed on the distance in front of the boat. Tom kept on undressing. He had his shoes and socks off. Under his pants he wore his swimsuit, like Dickie.\n\"I\'ll go in if you will!\" Tom shouted. \"Will you?\" He wanted Dickie to slow down.\n\"Will I? Sure!\" Dickie slowed the motor. He let go of the wheel and took off his jacket. The boat moved up and down, losing its speed. \"Come on,\" Dickie said, nodding at Tom\'s pants. \"Take them off.\"\nTom looked at the land. They were a long way from the white sand and pink houses of San Remo now. He picked up the oar slowly, playing with it between his knees, and when Dickie was pulling his pants down, Tom lifted the oar and swung it down hard on the top of Dickie\'s head.\n\"Hey!\" Dickie yelled, sliding half off the wooden seat.\nTom stood up and brought the oar down again.\n\"What the...!\" Dickie said, as he lost consciousness.\nTom hit him on the side of the neck three times. Finally the body relaxed and stopped moving. Tom straightened, getting his breath back painfully. He looked around him. There were no boats, nothing, except far, far away a little white one moving from left to right.\nTom stopped and pulled at Dickie\'s green ring. He put it in his pocket. The other ring was tighter, but it came off, over the bleeding hand. Then he reached for the rope that was tied to the heavy weight. He guessed the rope was about fourteen or fifteen meters long. He began to feel cooler and calmer. The cement weight should be just enough to hold a body down, he thought. The body might move around a little, but it wouldn\'t come up to the surface.\nTom pulled the body toward the edge of the boat, sliding it along the side. He began with Dickies head and shoulders, turned Dickie\'s body on its stomach, and pushed him out little by little. Dickie\'s head was in the water. Tom took a breath and pushed hard. Dickie went over the side of the boat.\nTom started the boat cautiously and headed toward the shore, north of San Remo. Maybe he could find a place, an empty area on the shore, where he could stop the boat and get out. He couldn\'t think of a way to get rid of the boat. He moved it toward a shallow, short beach until he felt it hit ground. Tom decided to sink the boat.\nThe little beach gave him a feeling of safety and privacy. There was no sign that a human foot had ever touched the place.\nTom began to gather stones and to drop them into the boat one by one. He worked without stopping because he was afraid somebody might find him if he stopped to rest. When the stones reached the top of the boat, he pushed the boat away from the beach and pushed it down, more and more, until water entered over the sides. As the boat began to sink, he gave it another push toward deeper water and walked with it until the water was up to his waist and the boat sank below his reach. Then he walked back to shore and lay down for a time, face down on the sand. He began to plan his story for the return to Mongibello.\n\n***\n\nTom stepped off the bus almost directly in front of Marge. She was in her swimsuit and the white jacket she always wore to the beach.\n\"Where\'s Dickie?\" she asked.\n\"He\'s in Rome,\" Tom smiled easily, absolutely prepared for Marge\'s questions. \"He\'s staying up there for a few days. I came down to get some of his stuff to take up to him.\"\n\"Is he staying with somebody?\"\n\"No, just in a hotel.\"\n\nTom began to walk toward the house and Marge followed him. Tom took the big iron key to the terrace door from its usual place. The table had been moved a little, and there was a book on the chair. Marge had been here since they left, Tom thought.\n\"Can I fix you a drink? \"\n\"No, thanks. How long do you think Dickie\'s going to be away?\n\nTom frowned thoughtfully. \"Well, I don\'t really know. He says he wants to see a lot of art shows up there. I think he\'s just enjoying a change of scene.\"\n\"How long are you staying?\"\n\"Just overnight. I\'ll be going up to Rome tomorrow. Probably in the afternoon.\"\n\"I don\'t suppose I\'ll see you again, unless you\'re at the beach. Have a good time in case I don\'t see you. And tell Dickie to write a postcard. What hotel is he staying at?\"\n\"Oh - uh - what\'s the name of it? Near the Piazza di Spagna?\"\n\"The Inghilterra?\"\n\"That\'s it. But I think he said to use the American Express as a mailing address.\"\n\"All right. Bye.\" Marge walked down the path to the iron gate, and out.\n\nTom picked up the suitcase and ran upstairs to Dickie\'s bedroom. He opened the drawers quickly and emptied them into the suitcase. There were letters, keys, address books, and clothes.\nHe wanted to take all of Dickies stuff straight away to Rome, but he worried about what Marge might think if he took so much for such a short time. He decided it would be better to pretend that Dickie had later made a decision to move to Rome.\nThe next day, Tom worked calmly and thoroughly, expecting Marge to come by at any minute, but it was after four before she came.\n\"Still here?\" she asked as she came into Dickie\'s room.\n\"Yes. I had a letter from Dickie today. He\'s decided he\'s going to move to Rome.\" Tom stood up and smiled a little. It seemed to be a surprise to him, too. \"He wants me to pick up all his things, all I can carry.\"\n\"Move to Rome? For how long? \"\n\"I don\'t know. The rest of the winter, at least.\"\n\"He\'s not coming back all winter?\" Marge sounded lost already.\n\"No. He said he might even sell the house.\"\n\"He\'s still going to Cortina, isn\'t he?\" Marge asked. Dickie and Marge had been planning to go on a Christmas vacation to Cortina with Freddie Miles.\n\"No, he\'s not. He said he was going to write Freddie and tell him he decided not to go.\"\n\nTom watched her shocked face. He knew she was wondering whether he was going to live with Dickie or not, and that she was probably deciding, because of his cheerful manner, that he was. Tom felt the question move up to her lips - and then she asked him: \"Are you going to stay with him in Rome?\"\n\"Maybe for a time. I\'ll help him with his apartment. I want to go to Paris this month, then I suppose around the middle of December I\'ll be going back to the States.\"\n\nA few minutes later, Marge stood up and said goodbye. Tom suddenly felt that she might be going to telephone Dickie today. Or maybe even go up to Rome. But what could she do if she did go? People change hotels. And there were enough hotels in Rome to keep her busy for days. When she didn\'t find him, she would suppose that he had gone to Paris or to another city with Tom Ripley.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30868, 11701),
(30871, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 5\n\nA New Identity\n\nTom left Mongibello by taxi around six o\'clock, after a cup of coffee at Giorgio\'s, where he said goodbye to his and Dickie\'s village friends. To all of them he told the same story, that Mr. Greenleaf was staying in Rome for the winter, and that he sent his greetings until he saw them again.\n\nOn the train, Tom wrote a letter to Marge. As soon as he arrived at the hotel in Rome, he typed it on Dickie\'s typewriter.\n\nRome\n\nNovember 28\n\n \n\nDear Marge,\n\nI\'ve decided to take an apartment in Rome for the winter, just to have a change of scene and get away from old Mongy. I feel a need to be by myself. I\'m sorry it was so sudden and that I didn\'t get a chance to say goodbye, but actually I\'m not far away, and I hope I\'ll see you now and then. I just didn\'t feel like going to pack my stuff, so I gave the job to Tom.\n\nYou had the wrong idea about Tom. He\'s going back to the States soon. He\'s really not a bad guy and I don\'t dislike him. He has nothing to do with us anyway, and I hope you realize that.\n\nWrite me at the American Express, Rome, until I know where I am. I\'m terribly sorry about Christmas, darling, but I don\'t think I should see you so soon, and you can hate me or not for that.\n\nAll my love, Dickie\n\n \n\nTom had kept his hat on when he entered the hotel, and he gave Dickie\'s passport in at the desk instead of his own. He also signed in with Dickie\'s signature. He spent that evening practicing Dickies signature for the bank checks. Dickie\'s monthly income was going to arrive from America in less than ten days.\n\nTom moved the next day to the Hotel Europa near the Via Veneto. He held imaginary conversations with Marge and Freddie in his hotel room. He spoke to her as Dickie in case she called. He had done so little to change his appearance, but even his expression, Tom thought, was like Dickie\'s now. He wore a smile that was dangerously welcoming to a stranger, a smile perfect to greet an old friend or a lover. It was Dickie\'s best and most typical smile when he was in a good mood.\n\nOn January 4 there was a letter from Marge. She was giving up her house on March 1, she said. She wrote:\n\nWhen am I going to see you? I hate missing a summer in Europe after I\'ve lived through another awful winter, but I think I\'ll go home in early March. Darling, it would be so wonderful if we could go home on the same boat together.\n\nIs there a possibility? I don\'t suppose there is. You\'re not going back to the US even for a short visit this winter?\n\nAs ever, Marge\n\n\nOn January 10, Tom wrote back to Marge:\n\nI\'m painting with a man called Di Massimo and am quite pleased with the results. I miss you, too, but if you can still live with my plan, I\'d prefer not to see you for several more weeks. Hello to Giorgio and his wife...\n\nIt was a letter like all of Dickie\'s letters, a letter that couldn\'t be called warm or cold, and said almost nothing.\n\nTom was receiving Dickie\'s checks now, so he had enough money to live as he wanted. He had found an apartment in a large apartment house in the Via Imperiale, near the Pincian Gate. He had signed a contract to stay a year, though he didn\'t plan to spend most of his time in Rome, especially the winter. He only wanted a home, after years of not having one. And Rome was exciting. Rome was part of his new life. He wanted to be able to say in Majorca or Athens or Cairo or wherever he was:\n\n\"Yes, I live in Rome, I keep an apartment.\"\n\n\"Keep\" was the way the international upper classes referred to their apartments. The apartment had a large living room, a bedroom, a kind of sitting room, kitchen, and bath. It suited the respectable neighborhood and the respectable life he wanted to lead.\n\nTom carefully avoided the Americans in Rome who might expect him to come to their parties and ask them to his, though he loved to chat with Americans and Italians in the Cafe Greco and in the students\' restaurants in the Via Margutta. He told his name only to an Italian painter named Carlino, whom he met in a Via Margutta bar; told him also that he painted and was studying with a painter called Di Massimo. If the police ever asked, this man could now tell them that Dickie Greenleaf had been painting in Rome in January.\n\nHe had a ticket for Majorca - by train to Naples, then the boat from Naples to Palma over the night of January 31 and February 1. He had bought two new suitcases from Guccis, the best leather products store in Rome.\n\nWhile Tom was packing his suitcases one morning, his doorbell rang. He supposed it was a salesperson, or a mistake. He had no name on his doorbell downstairs because he didn\'t like people to visit him. It rang for the second time, and Tom still ignored it, and went on with his lazy packing. He loved to pack, and he took a long time about it, a whole day or two days, laying Dickie\'s clothes carefully into suitcases, now and then trying on a good-looking shirt or a jacket in front of the mirror. He was standing in front of the mirror with one of Dickie\'s shirts, when there was a knock at his door.\n\nIt might be someone from Mongibello - someone who had found his address and wanted to surprise him. That was silly, he told himself. But his hands were cool with sweat as he went to the door. He felt faint, and was afraid he would fall down. He opened the door with both hands, though only a few centimeters.\n\n\"Hello!\" the American voice said out of the darkness of the hall. \"Dickie? It\'s Freddie.\"\n\nTom took a step back, holding the door open. \"He\'s - Won\'t you come in? He\'s not here right now. He should be back a little later.\"\n\nFreddie Miles came in, looking around. His fat, ugly face turned in every direction. How had he found the place, Tom wondered. Tom took his rings off quickly and pocketed them. And what else? He, too, looked around the room.\n\n\"You\'re staying with him?\" Freddie asked, with that strange stare that made his face look stupid and rather scared.\n\n\"Oh, no. I\'m just staying here for a few hours,\" Tom said, calmly removing Dickie\'s shirt. He had another shirt on under it. \"Dickies gone for lunch. Otello\'s, I think he said. He should be back around three at the latest.\" One of the apartment owners had probably let Freddie in, Tom thought, and told him which bell to press, and told him Mr. Greenleaf was in, too. Freddie had probably said he was an old friend of Dickie\'s. Now he would have to get Freddie out of the house without seeing Signora Buffi downstairs, because she always called out, \"Hello, Mr. Greenleaf.\"\n\n\"I met you in Mongibello, didn\'t I?\" Freddie asked. \"Aren\'t you Tom? I thought you were coming to Cortina.\"\n\n\"I couldn\'t go, thanks. How was the trip?\"\n\n\"Oh, fine. What happened to Dickie?\"\n\n\"Didn\'t he write to you? He decided to spend the winter in Rome. He told me he\'d written to you.\"\n\n\"Not a word. Marge told me he\'d moved to Rome, but she didn\'t have the address except the American Express office. It was only by luck that I met somebody at a restaurant last night who knew where he lived.\"\n\nFreddie had walked toward the bedroom and stopped, looking at the suitcases on the bed. \"Is Dickie leaving for somewhere, or did he just get here?\" he asked, turning.\n\n\"He\'s leaving. Didn\'t Marge tell you? He\'s going to Sicily.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"Tomorrow. Or late tonight. I\'m not quite sure.\"\n\n\"So what\'s the matter with Dickie lately?\" Freddie asked, frowning. \"What\'s the idea of hiding from everybody?\"\n\n\"He says he\'s been working pretty hard this winter,\" Tom said.\n\n\"He seems to want privacy, but as far as I know he\'s still friendly with everybody, including Marge.\"\n\nTom turned around and saw Freddie staring at the silver identification bracelet on his left wrist. It was Dickie\'s bracelet, which Tom had never seen him wearing, but had found with Dickie\'s clothes. Freddie had clearly seen it before. Tom put on his coat slowly and calmly.\n\nFreddie was looking at him now with a different expression, with a little surprise. Tom knew what Freddie was thinking. He sensed danger.\n\n\"Ready to go?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"You live here, don\'t you?\"\n\n\"No!\" Tom protested, smiling. The fat, ugly face stared at him from under the bright red hair. If they could get out without seeing Signora Buffi downstairs, Tom thought he would be safe.\n\n\"Let\'s go.\"\n\n\"I see you\'re wearing Dickie\'s jewelry.\"\n\nTom couldn\'t think of a single thing to say, a single joke to make. \"Oh, just for a day or two,\" he said in his deepest voice. \"Dickie got tired of wearing it, so he told me to wear it.\" He meant the identification bracelet, but there was also the silver pin on his tie, with the G on it. Tom had bought the pin himself. He could feel the anger growing in Freddie Miles. Tom was afraid of his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, I\'m ready to go,\" Freddie said seriously, getting up.\n\n\"I\'ve just remembered I have to make a telephone call,\" Tom said. \"I\'ll meet you there.\"\n\nFreddie walked to the door and turned with a swing of his broad shoulders. \"That\'s the Otello not far from the Inghilterra?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom said. \"He\'s supposed to be there by one o\'clock.\"\n\nFreddie nodded. \"Nice to see you again,\" he said in an unfriendly manner, and closed the door.\n\nTom whispered a curse. He opened the door slightly and listened to the sound of Freddie\'s shoes going down the stairs. He wanted to make sure Freddie left without speaking to one of the Buffis again. Then he heard Freddie\'s \"Hello, ma\'am.\"\n\nFreddie was talking with Signora Buffi. The woman\'s voice came more clearly.\n\n\"... only Mr. Greenleaf,\" she was saying. \"No, only one... Mr. Who?... No, sir... I do not think he has gone out today at all, but I could be wrong!\" She laughed.\n\nTom twisted his hands, imagining that they were around Freddie\'s neck. Then he heard Freddie\'s footsteps running up the stairs. Tom stepped back into the apartment and closed the door. He could go on saying that he didn\'t live here, that Dickie was at Otello\'s, or that he didn\'t know where Dickie was, but Freddie wouldn\'t stop now until he found Dickie. Or Freddie would drag him downstairs and ask Signora Buffi who he was.\n\nFreddie knocked on the door. The handle turned. It was locked. Tom picked up a heavy glass ashtray. He couldn\'t get his hand around it, and he had to hold it by the edge. He tried to think just for two seconds more: wasn\'t there another solution? What would he do with the body? He couldn\'t think. This was the only way. He opened the door with his left hand. His right hand, with the glass ashtray, was pulled back and down.\n\nFreddie came into the room. \"Listen, would you mind telling...\"\n\nThe hard edge of the ashtray hit the middle of his head. Freddie looked shocked. Then his knees bent and he went down like a bull hit between the eyes with a hammer, Tom kicked the door shut. He slammed the edge of the ashtray into the back of Freddie\'s neck. He hit the neck again and again, scared that Freddie might be only pretending and that one of his great arms might suddenly grab his legs and pull him down. Then he felt Freddie\'s wrist for a pulse. There was a faint one, though it seemed to stop as he touched. In the next second it was gone.\n\nHe searched Freddie\'s pockets. A wallet. The American passport in the inside pocket of the overcoat. Mixed Italian and some other kind of coins. Two car keys on a ring that said FIAT. He searched the wallet for a license. There it was, with all the details. He went to the front window, then nearly smiled because it was so simple: there stood the black car across the street, almost directly in front of the house. He could not be sure, but he thought there was no one in it.\n\nHe suddenly knew what he was going to do. He set Freddie up against the wall, and poured some strong alcohol from a bottle down his throat. He had hours of time, but he didn\'t stop until the room was ready, the two dozen smoked cigarettes and a glass of alcohol broken and only half-cleaned up from the bathroom floor. The curious thing was that he knew he would have the whole apartment cleaned up by eight o\'clock. According to the story he was going to tell, Freddie would leave his house by seven, and Dickie Greenleaf was a fairly neat young man, even with a few drinks in him. Tom was dirtying the house only so that he would believe the story he was going to tell.\n\nAt ten to eight, Tom dragged Freddie\'s dead body out of the apartment and began to walk down the stairs. On the way down he stopped, hearing someone come out of an apartment on the second floor. He waited for a moment and then continued. He didn\'t want to rest going down the stairs. Fortunately nobody else came out of any of the apartments or in the front door.\n\nThe street looked normal. If anyone came over, Tom thought, he would blow such a breath of alcohol in his face that there wouldn\'t be any reason to ask what was the matter. He paused a moment for a car to pass and then took a few heavy steps to Freddie\'s car. He pushed Freddie\'s head and one shoulder through the open window of the car while he breathed deeply.\n\n\"Can I help you?\" a voice asked in Italian.\n\n\"Ah, no, no, thanks,\" Tom replied with drunken happiness. \" I know where he lives,\" he said in English.\n\nThe man nodded, smiling a little, too, and walked on.\n\nTom swung Freddie out on the door, pulled him around the door and onto the car seat, came around the car, and pulled Freddie into the seat beside the drivers seat. He put Freddie\'s key in and the car started quickly. They were off. Down the hill to the Via Veneto, past the American Library, over to the Piazza Venezia, through the Forum, past the Colosseum, a grand tour of Rome that Freddie could not appreciate.\n\nTom began to look around for the right spot. There was a place ahead with three or four trees near the edge of the road and surely a tomb behind them. Tom pulled off the road by the trees and shut off his lights. He waited a moment, watching both ends of the straight, empty road.\n\nFreddie\'s body was still soft. Tom dragged him roughly now through the dirt and stopped behind the last tree, behind what remained of a tomb, which was probably only a meter high, he thought, and quite good enough for this pig. Tom cursed his ugly weight and kicked him suddenly in the chin. Then he walked back to his car on his exhausted, weak legs and turned the car around toward Rome again. He was tired, tired to the point of crying, and sick of the sight of Freddie Miles.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30870, 11701),
(30873, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 6\n\nThe Hunt for Clues\n\nTom went out before eight in the morning to buy the papers. There was nothing. They might not find Freddie for days, Tom thought. Nobody was likely to walk around an unimportant tomb like the one he had put Freddie behind.\n\nHe was dressed by nine and had even spoken to Signora Buffi to tell her he would be gone for at least three weeks.\n\nThe telephone rang, and Tom picked it up.\n\n\"Mr. Greenleaf?\" asked the Italian voice.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe voice stated that the body of Frederick Miles had been found that morning and hadn\'t Mr. Miles visited him yesterday afternoon?\n\n\"Yes, that is true.\"\n\n\"Would you be kind enough to answer some questions? A police officer will come to you.\"\n\n\"I will be very glad to help if I can,\" Tom said in slow, careful Italian, \"but can the officer come now? It is necessary for me to leave the house at ten o\'clock.\"\n\nThe voice made a little sound and said probably not, but they would try.\n\nTom hurried to push a couple of suitcases under the bed, and carried the other to a closet and shut the door. He didn\'t want the police to think he was planning to leave town. But what was he nervous about? They probably didn\'t have any clues.\n\nMaybe a friend of Freddies had known that Freddie was going to try to see him yesterday, that was all. Tom picked up a paint brush and put it in a cup of water. He didn\'t want to look too upset by the news of Freddie\'s death to do a little painting while he waited for them, though he was dressed to go out. He was going to be a friend of Freddie\'s, but not a very close friend.\n\nSignora Buffi let the police in at ten-thirty. There were two: an older man in the uniform of an officer and a younger man in an ordinary police uniform. The older man greeted him politely and asked to see his passport. Tom produced it, and the officer looked carefully from Tom to the picture of Dickie, more carefully than anyone had ever looked at it before. Tom thought the officer would ask him about it, but he didn\'t. He handed Tom the passport with a little smile.\n\n\"How was he killed?\" Tom asked.\n\n\"He was hit on the head and in the neck by a heavy object,\" the officer replied, \"and robbed. We think he was drunk. Was he drunk when he left your apartment yesterday afternoon?\"\n\n\"Well - a little. We had both been drinking.\"\n\nThe officer wrote this down in his book, and also the time that Tom said Freddie had been there, from, about twelve until about six.\n\n\"Do you know where he was going when he left?\" the officer asked.\n\n\"No, I don\'t.\"\n\n\"But you thought he was able to drive?\"\n\n\"Oh, yes. If he had been too drunk to drive, I would have gone with him.\"\n\nThe officer asked another question that Tom pretended not quite to understand. The officer asked it a second time, choosing different words, and smiled at the younger police officer. The officer wanted to know what his relationship to Freddie had been.\n\n\"A friend,\" Tom said. \"Not a very close friend. I had not seen or heard from him in about two months. I was terribly upset to hear about the disaster this morning.\" Tom let his anxious face express what his rather simple vocabulary couldn\'t. He thought he succeeded. He thought the questioning wasn\'t very serious, and that they were going to leave in another minute or two.\n\n\"He said nothing about making a trip to the Via Appia when he left your apartment?\"\n\n\"No,\" Tom said.\n\n\"What did you do yesterday after Mr. Miles left?\"\n\n\"I stayed here,\" Tom said, moving his open hands as Dickie had done,\" and then I had a little sleep, and later I went out for a walk around eight or eight-thirty.\" A man who lived in the house, whose name Tom didn\'t know, had seen him come in last night at about a quarter to nine, and they had said good evening to each other.\n\n\"You took a walk alone? \"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And Mr. Miles left here alone? He was not going to meet anybody?\"\n\n\"He didn\'t say so.\" Tom wondered if Freddie had had friends with him at his hotel, or wherever he had been staying. Tom hoped that the police wouldn\'t introduce him to any of Freddie\'s friends who might know Dickie. Now his name - Richard Greenleaf - would be in the Italian newspapers, Tom thought, and also his address. He\'d have to move. It was awful. He cursed to himself. The police officer saw him, but it looked like a curse against the sad end of Freddie, Tom thought.\n\n\"We are searching the car now. Maybe the murderer was somebody he picked up to give a ride to. Shall we be able to reach you here for the next few days, in case there are any more questions? \"\n\nTom hesitated. \"I was planning to leave for Majorca tomorrow.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, but we may need to contact you in the next couple of days,\" he stated quietly. He was not giving Tom the opportunity to argue about it, even if he was an American. \"We shall inform you as soon as you may go. I am sorry if you have made travel plans. Perhaps there is still time to change them. Good day, Mr. Greenleaf.\"\n\n\"Good day.\" Tom stood there after they had closed the door. He could move to a hotel, he thought, if he told the police what hotel it was. He didn\'t want Freddie\'s friends or any friends of Dickie\'s coming to see him after they saw his address in the newspapers.\n\nBefore an hour had passed, he was at the Inghilterra. His three suitcases, two of them Dickie\'s and one his own, depressed him: he had packed them for such a different purpose. And now this!\n\nHe went out at noon to buy the papers. Every one of the papers had the news:\n\nAMERICAN MURDERED ON THE VIA APPIA ANTICA... SHOCKING MURDER OF WEALTHY AMERICAN FREDERICK MILES LAST NIGHT ON THE VIA APPIA... VIA APPIA MURDER OF AMERICAN WITHOUT CLUES...\n\nTom read every word. There really were no clues, at least not yet, and no suspects. But every paper gave the name Herbert Richard Greenleaf and gave his address as the place where Freddie had last been seen by anybody.\n\nThe phone didn\'t ring all afternoon. At about eight, when it was dark, Tom went downstairs to buy the evening papers. He sat in a little restaurant a few streets away, reading them. Still no clues.\n\nTom drank his glass of wine slowly, and looked through each of the papers for the last-minute articles that were sometimes put into Italian papers just before they came out. He found nothing more on the Miles case. But on the last page of the last newspaper he read: SUNKEN BOAT WITH BLOODSTAINS FOUND NEAR SAN REMO\n\nHe read it rapidly, with more terror in his heart than he had felt when he had carried Freddie\'s body down the stairs, or when the police had come to question him. This was like a bad dream come true. The boat was described in detail and it brought the scene back to him - Dickie smiling in the boat, Dickie smiling at him, Dickie\'s body sinking through the water. The article said that the stains were believed to be blood, not that they were. It didn\'t say what the police or anybody else planned to do about them. But the police would do something, Tom thought. His imagination went in several directions: what would they think if they searched for Dickie\'s body and found it? They would think that it was Tom Ripley\'s now. Dickie would be suspected of murder. Then Dickie would be suspected of Freddie\'s murder, too. Tom sat in his room wondering what would happen if he did nothing, and what he could make happen by his own actions.\n\nMarge would come up to Rome. She had obviously called the Rome police to get his address. If she came up, he would have to see her as Tom, and try to persuade her that Dickie was out, as he had with Freddie. He mustn\'t see Marge, that was all. Everything would be a disaster if he saw her. It\'d be the end of everything! But if he could be patient, nothing at all would happen. It was just this moment, he thought, just this murder, that made things so difficult. But absolutely nothing would happen to him, if he could keep doing and saying the right things to everybody. Afterward everything would be OK again.\n\nHe picked up the telephone, and told the man at the hotel desk that if Miss Marjorie Sherwood called again, he would accept the call. He thought he could persuade her in two minutes that everything was all right and that Freddie\'s murder didn\'t concern him at all. He would say that he had moved to a hotel to avoid annoying telephone calls from strangers but still be within reach of the police in case they wanted him to identify any suspects they picked up.\n\nHe lay down on the bed, tired, but not ready to undress. Tom imagined Dickie smiling at him, dressed in the suit that he had worn in San Remo. The suit and tie were completely wet. Dickie bent over him, shaking him. \"I swam!\" he said. \"Tom, wake up! I\'m all right! I swam! I\'m alive!\" Tom moved away from his touch. He heard Dickie laugh at him, Dickie\'s happy, deep laugh. \"I swam!\" Dickie\'s voice yelled, ringing and ringing in Tom\'s ears.\n\nTom looked around the room, looking for Dickie in the yellow light under the lamp, in the dark corner. Tom felt his own eyes open wide, frightened, and though he knew his fear was silly, he kept looking everywhere for Dickie, below the curtains at the window, and on the floor on the other side of the bed. He pulled himself up from the bed and walked, almost falling, across the room, and opened a window. He felt drugged. He sat beneath the window, breathing the cold air in. Finally he went into the bathroom and wet his face at the sink. He had let his imagination go crazy. He had been out of control.\n\n***\n\nThe first thing he thought of when he woke up was Marge. He reached for the telephone and asked if she had called during the night. She hadn\'t. He had a terrible feeling that she was coming up to Rome.\n\nVery strangely, there was nothing in the papers about either the Miles case or the San Remo boat. It frightened him.\n\nThe telephone rang and he jumped for it obediently. It was either Marge or the police.\n\n\"There are two officers of the police downstairs to see you, sir.\"\n\nA minute later, he heard their footsteps in the carpeted hall. It was the same older officer as yesterday, with a different younger policeman.\n\nThey took the chairs Tom offered. \"Are you a friend of the American Thomas Ripley?\" the older officer asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom said.\n\n\"Do you know where he is?\"\n\n\"I think he went back to America about a month ago.\"\n\n\"I see. That will have to be checked. You see, we are trying to find Thomas Ripley. We think he may be dead.\"\n\n\"Dead? Why?\"\n\nThe officer seemed to be smiling between each sentence. The smile had bothered Tom a little yesterday, too. \"You were with him on a trip to San Remo in November, were you not? \"\n\nThey had checked the hotels. \"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where did you last see him? In San Remo?\"\n\n\"No. I saw him again in Rome.\" Tom remembered that Marge knew he had gone back to Rome after Mongibello, because he had said he was going to help Dickie in his new apartment in Rome.\n\n\"When did you last see him?\"\n\n\"I don\'t know the exact date. Something like two months ago, I think. I think I had a postcard from - from Genoa, saying that he was going back to America. Why do you think he is dead?\"\n\n\"Did you take a boat ride with Thomas Ripley in San Remo?\"\n\n\"I think we did. Yes, I remember. Why?\"\n\n\"Because a little boat has been found with some kind of stains on it that may be blood. It was lost on November 25 - the day you were in San Remo with Mr. Ripley.\" The officer\'s eyes rested on him without moving.\n\nThe friendliness of the look angered Tom. It wasn\'t honest, he felt. But he made an effort to behave well. \"But nothing happened to us on the boat ride. There was no accident.\"\n\n\"Did you bring the boat back?\"\n\n\"Of course.\" It was obvious what was going on in the officer\'s head: Dickie Greenleaf had twice been on the scene of a murder, or near enough. The missing Thomas Ripley had taken a boat ride on November 25 with Dickie Greenleaf. \"Are you saying you do not believe me when I tell you that I saw Tom Ripley in Rome around December 1?\"\n\n\"Oh, no, I didn\'t say that! I wanted to hear what you would say about your travels with Mr. Ripley after San Remo, because we cannot find him.\" He smiled again.\n\n\"If he\'s not in America, you could try Paris or Genoa.\"\n\n\"We will,\" the officer said. He put his papers away. He had made at least a dozen notes on them.\n\n\"Before you go,\" Tom said in a nervous voice, \"I want to ask you when I can leave the city. I was planning to go to Sicily.

We shall keep you informed, sir. Good day!\"\n', 1, 1, 0, '', 30872, 11701);

(30875, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 7\n\nThe Waiting Game\n\nTom had no plan to try to run away from anything. He just wanted to get out of Rome. He was desperate to get out! He threw the last objects into his suitcase and slammed the lid down and locked it.\n\nThe phone again! Tom picked it up quickly. \"Hello?\"\n\n\"Oh, Dickie - !\"\n\nIt was Marge and she was downstairs, he could tell from the sound. Surprised, he said in Tom\'s voice,\" Who\'s this?\"\n\n\"Is this Tom?\"\n\n\"Marge! Well, hello. Where are you?\"\n\n\"I\'m downstairs. Is Dickie there? Can I come up?\"\n\n\"You can come up in about five minutes,\" Tom said with a laugh.\n\n\"Is Dickie there? \"\n\n\"Not at the moment. He went out about a half an hour ago, but he\'ll be back soon. I know where he is, if you want to find him.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"At the eighty-third police station. No, excuse me, it\'s the eighty-seventh.\"\n\n\"Is he in any trouble? \"\n\n\"No, just answering questions. He was supposed to be there at ten. Want me to give you the address?\" He wished he hadn\'t started talking in Tom\'s voice: why hadn\'t he pretended to be a servant, some friend of Dickie\'s, anybody, and told her that Dickie was out for hours?\n\nMarge wasn\'t happy. \"No - o. I\'ll wait for him.\"\n\n\"Here it is!\" Tom said, pretending to find the address. \"Twenty-one Via Perugia. Do you know where that is?\" Tom didn\'t, but he was going to send her in the opposite direction from the American Express, where he wanted to go for his mail before he left town.\n\n\"I don\'t want to go,\" Marge said.\" I\'ll come up and wait with you if it\'s all right.\"\n\n\"Well, it\'s -\" He laughed the laugh that Marge knew so well. \"The thing is, I\'m expecting somebody any minute. It\'s a business interview. About a job. Believe it or not, old Ripley\'s trying to put himself to work.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said Marge, not in the least interested. \"Well, how is Dickie? Why does he have to talk to the police?\"\n\n\"Oh! Just because he had some drinks with Freddie that day. You saw the papers, didn\'t you? \"\n\n\"How long has Dickie been living here?\"\n\n\"Here? Oh, just overnight. I\'ve been up north. When I heard about Freddie, I came down to Rome to see him. If it hadn\'t been for the police, I\'d never have found him! I\'m awfully glad you\'re in town, Marge. Dickie\'ll be so happy to see you. He\'s been worried about what you might think of all this in the papers.\"\n\n\"Oh, has he?\" Marge said, surprised, but obviously pleased.\n\n\"Why don\'t you wait for me in Angelo\'s? It\'s that bar right down the street in front of the hotel as you go toward the Piazza di Spagna steps. I\'ll see if I can come out and have a drink or a coffee with you in about five minutes, OK?\"\n\n\"Oh, all right. Angelo\'s?\"\n\n\"You can\'t miss it. On the street straight in front of the hotel. Bye-bye.\"\n\nTom quickly called for his bill to be prepared and for somebody to carry his luggage, and then he walked downstairs.\n\nHe wanted to see if Marge was still in the hotel, waiting there for him, or possibly still there making another telephone call.\n\nShe wasn\'t there. Tom paid his bill. \"If anybody asks for me, would you say that I\'ve left the city?\" Tom asked the man at the desk.\n\nTom went out to his waiting taxi. \"Would you take me to the American Express, please?\" he asked the driver.\n\n***\n\nThe boat approached Palermo harbor slowly. He had spent two days in Naples, and there had been nothing of any interest in the papers and the police had made no attempt to contact him. But maybe they had just not bothered to look for him in Naples, he thought, and were waiting for him in Palermo at the hotel. But there were no police on the dock and no police in the hotel either. Tom felt so happy that he went over to the mail counter and asked boldly if there was any message for Mr. Richard Greenleaf. The clerk told him there wasn\'t.\n\nThen he began to relax. There wasn\'t even a message from Marge. Maybe Marge had given Dickie up after this situation. Maybe she\'d realized that Dickie was running away from her.\n\nHe dressed, put on one of his new traveling suits, and walked out into the Palermo early evening. There across the square was the great cathedral he had read about in a guidebook. Tomorrow he would begin his visit, but this moment was wonderful, he thought, as he stopped to stare at the tall cathedral in front of him. Wonderful to look at the dusty walls and to think of going inside tomorrow, to imagine its smell, made up of hundreds and hundreds of years.\n\nBeyond Sicily came Greece. He definitely wanted to see Greece. He wanted to see Greece as Dickie Greenleaf, with Dickie\'s money, Dickie\'s clothes, Dickie\'s way of behaving with strangers. But would it happen that he couldn\'t see Greece as Dickie Greenleaf? Would one thing after another happen to stop him - murder, the police, people? He hadn\'t wanted to murder, it had been necessary. The idea of going to Greece, walking over the Acropolis as Tom Ripley, American tourist, held no charm for him at all. He would rather not go. Tears came in his eyes as he stared up at the cathedral, and then he turned away.\n\nThere was a fat letter from Marge the next morning. Tom squeezed it between his fingers and smiled. He was sure he knew what it said because it was so fat. He read it at breakfast. He enjoyed every line of it with his breakfast. It was all he had hoped for and more.\n\n...If you really didn\'t know that I had come by your hotel, that only means that Tom didn\'t tell you, which gives me my answer. It\'s pretty obvious now that you\'re running out and can\'t face me. Why don\'t you admit that you can\'t live without your little friend? I\'m only sorry, old boy, that you didn\'t have the courage to tell me this before and directly. What do you think I am, a small-town fool who doesn\'t know about such things?\n\nSuccess Number Two of my Roman holiday is informing the police that Tom Ripley is with you. They seemed in a desperate hurry to find him. (I wonder why? What\'s he done now?) I also informed the police in my best Italian that you and Tom are always together and that I could not imagine how they found you and missed Tom.\n\nI\'ll be leaving for the States around the end of March. I\'m not angry, Dickie boy I just thought you had more courage.\n\nThanks for all the wonderful memories. They\'re like something in a museum already. Best wishes for the future,\n\nMarge\n\nFive days passed, calm, lonely but very pleasant days in which he wandered around Palermo, stopping here and there for an hour or two in a cafe or a restaurant and reading his travel books and the newspaper. He visited a palace, the Palermo library, with its paintings and papers in glass cases. He wrote letters to people in New York.\n\nBut he was lonely. He had imagined himself making a bright new group of friends with whom he would start a new life with new attitudes, standards, and habits that would be much better and clearer than the ones he had had all his life. Now he realized that it couldn\'t be. He would have to keep a distance from people, always. He was alone, and it was a lonely game he was playing. The friends he might make were most of the danger, of course. If he had to wander around the world alone, well, there was much less chance that he would be found out. That was one cheerful side of it, anyway, and he felt better after he had thought of it.\n\nHe changed his behavior slightly, to suit the role of an observer of life. He was still polite and smiling to everyone, to people who wanted to borrow his newspaper in restaurants and to workers he spoke to in the hotel, but he carried his head even higher and he spoke a little less when he spoke. There was a sadness about him now. He enjoyed the change. He imagined that he looked like a young man who had had an unhappy love affair or emotional disaster, and was trying to recover by visiting some of the more beautiful places on the earth.\n\n\"Hello! How are you?\" He greeted the man behind the hotel desk with a smile.\n\n\"A letter for you, sir. Very urgent,\" the man said, smiling, too.\n\nIt was from Dickie\'s bank in Naples. Inside the envelope was another envelope from Dickie\'s bank in New York. Tom read the letter from the Naples bank first.\n\n\nFebruary 10\n\n \n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been brought to our attention by the Wendell Trust Company of New York, that there exists a doubt whether your signature on your check of five hundred dollars of last January is your own. We are informing you as quickly as possible so that we can take the necessary action.\n\nWe have already decided that it is best to inform the police, but we shall wait for your reply. Any information you may be able to give us will be most appreciated, and we beg you to communicate with us as soon as possible.\n\nMost respectfully,\n\nEmilio di Braganzi Secretary General,\n\nthe Bank of Naples\n\nP.S. If the signature is in fact yours, we ask you to visit our office in Naples as soon as possible to sign your name again for our permanent records.\n\nTom tore open the letter from the New York bank.\n\n \n\nFebruary 5\n\nDear Mr. Greenleaf:\n\nOur Department of Signatures has reported to us that in its opinion your signature of January on your regular monthly check, No. 8747, is not yours. We inform you so that you may let us know if you signed the check or inform us that the check has been stolen. We have brought this to the attention of the Bank of Naples also.\n\nWe are sending you a card for our permanent signature file which we request you to sign and return to us. Please let us hear from you as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely, Edward T. Cavanach Secretary\n\n \n\nTom wet his lips. He would write to both banks that he was not missing any money at all. But would that stop them for long? He had signed three checks, beginning in December. Were they going to go back and check on all his signatures now? Would somebody be able to tell that all three signatures were not Dickie\'s?\n\nTom went upstairs and immediately sat down at the typewriter. Most false signatures took months to be discovered, he thought. Why had they noticed this one in four weeks? Wasn\'t it because they were checking on him in every department of his life, since the Freddie Miles murder and the San Remo boat story? They wanted to see him personally in the Naples bank. Maybe some of the men there knew Dickie by sight. A terrible fear ran over his shoulders and down his legs. For a moment he felt weak, too weak to move. He saw himself surrounded by a dozen policemen, Italian and American. They were asking him where Dickie Greenleaf was, and he was unable to produce Dickie Greenleaf or tell them where he was, or prove that he existed. He imagined himself trying to sign \"H. Richard Greenleaf\" under the eyes of a dozen witnesses, and falling apart suddenly and not being able to write at all.\n\n \n\nFebruary 12\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nIn reply to your letter concerning my January check:\n\nI signed the check myself and received all of the money. If I had missed the check, I would of course have informed you at once.\n\nI am returning the card with my signature for your permanent record as you requested.\n\nSincerely, H. Richard Greenleaf\n\n \n\nHe signed Dickie\'s signature several times on the back of the bank\'s envelope before he signed his letter and then the card.\n\nThen he wrote a similar letter to the Naples bank, and promised to go to the bank within the next few days and sign his name again for their permanent record. He marked both envelopes \"Urgent,\" and then mailed them.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30874, 11701),
(30877, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 8\n\nThe Return of Tom Ripley\n\n83 Police Station Rome February 14\n\nDear Mr. Greenleaf:\n\nYou are urgently requested to come to Rome to answer some important questions concerning Thomas Ripley. Your presence would be most appreciated and would greatly speed up our work.\n\nFailure to come to us within a week will cause us to take certain steps which will be annoying for us and for you.\n\nMost respectfully yours Captain Enrico Farrara\n\nSo they were still looking for Tom. But maybe it meant that something had happened on the Miles case, too, Tom thought. The Italians didn\'t call in an American using words like these. In the last paragraph they were actually threatening him. And, of course, they knew about the signature on the check by now.\n\nHe stood with the letter in his hand, looking around the room. He saw himself in the mirror; the corners of his mouth were turned down, his eyes were anxious and scared, and because the way he looked was the way he felt, he suddenly became twice as frightened. He folded the letter and pocketed it, then took it out of his pocket and tore it into pieces.\n\nHe began to pack rapidly. This was the end of Dickie Greenleaf, he knew. He hated becoming Thomas Ripley again, hated being nobody, hated putting on his old set of habits again. Now people would look down on him and be bored with him unless he put on an act for them. Tom Ripley always felt stupid and unable to do anything with himself except entertain people for minutes at a time. He hated going back to himself as he would hate putting on a dirty old suit of clothes, a suit of clothes that had not been very good even when it was new. His tears fell on Dickie\'s blue and white shirt that lay on top in the suitcase. It had Dickie\'s initials on it. He began to count up the things of Dickie\'s that he could still keep because they had no initials, or because no one would remember that they were Dickie\'s and not his own.\n\nTom paid his bill at the hotel, but he had to wait until the next day for a boat away from the island. He reserved the boat ticket in the name of Greenleaf, thinking that this was the last time he would ever reserve a ticket in the name of Greenleaf, but that maybe it wouldn\'t be, either. He couldn\'t give up the idea that the problem might go away. Just might. And for that reason it was senseless to give up hope. There was no point in being desperate, anyway, even as Tom Ripley. Tom Ripley had never really been desperate, though he had often looked it. Hadn\'t he learned something from these last months? If you wanted to be cheerful or sad, or hopeful, or thoughtful, or polite, you simply had to act those things.\n\nA very cheerful thought came to him when he awoke on the last morning in Palermo: he could leave all Dickie\'s clothes at the American Express in Venice under a different name and pick them up at some future time, if he wanted to or had to, or else never pick them up at all. It made him feel much better to know that Dickie\'s good shirts, his identification bracelet, and his wrist- watch would be safely stored somewhere, instead of lying at the bottom of the ocean or in a trashcan in Sicily.\n\nSo, after removing the initials from Dickie\'s two suitcases, he sent them, locked, from Naples to the American Express Company in Venice, together with two paintings he had begun in Palermo. He sent them in the name of Robert S. Fanshaw, to be stored until they were collected.\n\n***\n\nTom took a train from Naples up through Rome, Florence, Bologna, and Verona, where he got out and went by bus to the town of Trento about sixty kilometers away. He didn\'t want to buy a car in a town as big as Verona, because the police might notice his name when he obtained his license plates, he thought. In Trento, he bought a used car for about eight hundred dollars. He bought it in the name of Thomas Ripley, as his passport read, and took a hotel room in that name to wait the twenty-four hours until his license plates would be ready. By noon the next day he had his plates on his car and nothing had happened. There was nothing in the papers about the search for Thomas Ripley. It made him feel rather strange, rather safe and happy; perhaps the whole situation was unreal. He began to feel happy even in his boring role as Thomas Ripley. He took a pleasure in it, almost overdoing the old Tom Ripley shyness with strangers. Would anyone, anyone, believe that such a person had ever committed a murder? And the only murder he could possibly be suspected of was Dickie\'s in San Remo, and the police didn\'t seem to be getting very far on that. Life as Tom Ripley had one positive, at least: it freed his mind of guilt for the stupid, unnecessary murder of Freddie Miles.\n\nThe next night he spent in Venice. He found Venice much bigger than he had imagined. He found he could walk across the whole city by the narrow streets and bridges without setting foot in a boat. He chose a hotel very near the Rialto bridge called the Costanza, a hotel which was neither famous nor a cheap one on the back streets. It was clean, inexpensive, and convenient to places of interest. It was just the hotel for Tom Ripley.\n\nAs he spent a couple of hours in his room, Tom imagined the conversation he was going to have with the police before long... Well, I haven\'t any idea. I saw him in Rome. If you\'ve any doubt of that, you can ask Miss Marjorie Sherwood... Of course I\'m Tom Ripley! (He would give a laugh.) I can\'t understand what all the problem is about!... San Remo? Yes, I remember. We brought the boat back after an hour... Yes, I came back to Rome after Mongibello, but I didn\'t stay more than a couple of nights. I\'ve been wandering around the north of Italy... I\'m afraid I haven\'t any idea where he is, but I saw him about three weeks ago...\n\nTom got up from his chair smiling, changed his shirt and tie for the evening, and went out to find a pleasant restaurant for dinner. A good restaurant, he thought. Tom Ripley could order something expensive for once. His pocket was so full of money that it wouldn\'t bend. He had cashed a thousand dollars\' worth of travelers\' checks in Dickie\'s name before he left Palermo.\n\nTom entered a small, lighted street. It was full of restaurants, and he chose a very large and respectable-looking place with white tablecloths and brown wooden walls, the kind of restaurants which experience had taught him by now concentrated on food and not appearance. He took a table and opened one of the newspapers.\n\nAnd there it was, a short article on the second page:\n\nPOLICE SEARCH FOR MISSING AMERICAN Dickie Greenleaf, Friend of the Murdered Freddie Miles, Missing After Sicilian Holiday\n\nThe article stated that H. Richard (Dickie) Greenleaf, a close friend of Frederick Miles, the American murdered three weeks ago in Rome, had disappeared after taking a boat from Palermo to Naples. Both the Sicilian and Roman police had been informed and were looking for him. A final paragraph said that Greenleaf had just been requested by the Rome police to answer questions concerning the disappearance of Thomas Ripley, also a close friend of Greenleaf. Ripley had been missing for about three months, the paper said.\n\nThe next morning there was a long story in another newspaper, saying in only one small paragraph that Thomas Ripley was missing, but stating very boldly that Richard Greenleaf\'s absence was \"making the police suspect his guilt,\" and that he should go immediately to the police to discuss the situation. The paper also mentioned the forged checks.\n\nOn his walk around the city the next morning, he decided that he had to identify himself, immediately. It would look worse for him, whatever happened, the longer he waited. When he left the cathedral, he inquired of a policeman where the nearest police station was. He asked it sadly. He felt sad. He wasn\'t afraid, but he felt that identifying himself as Thomas Phelps Ripley was going to be one of the saddest things he had ever done in his life.\n\n\"You are Thomas Ripley?\" the captain of police asked, with no more interest than if Tom had been a dog that had been lost and was now found. \"May I see your passport?\"\n\nTom handed it to him. \"I don\'t know what the trouble is, but when I saw in the papers that I am believed to be missing - \" It was all sad and boring, just as he had expected. \"What happens now?\" Tom asked the officer.\n\n\"I shall telephone to Rome,\" the officer answered calmly, and picked up the telephone on his desk.\n\nThere was a few minutes\' wait for the Rome line, and then the officer announced to someone in Rome that the American, Thomas Ripley, was in Venice. Then the officer said to Tom, \"They would like to see you in Rome. Can you go to Rome today?\"\n\nTom frowned. \"I wasn\'t planning to go to Rome.\"\n\n\"I shall tell them,\" the officer said, and spoke into the telephone again.\n\nNow he was arranging for the Rome police to come to him. There were still some advantages to being an American citizen, Tom supposed.\n\nTom spent the rest of the day in his room, quietly thinking, reading, and making small changes to his appearance. He thought it quite possible that they would send the same man who had spoken to him in Rome.\n\nAt eight-thirty that evening his telephone rang, and the man from the hotel desk announced that Lieutenant Roverini was downstairs.\n\n\"Would you have him come up, please?\" Tom said.\n\nTom opened the door in a lazy way. \"Good evening.\"\n\n\"Good evening. Lieutenant Roverini from the Roman Police.\" Behind him came another tall, silent young police officer - not another, Tom realized suddenly, but the one who had been with the lieutenant when Tom had first met Roverini in the apartment in Rome.\n\n\"You are a friend of Mr. Richard Greenleaf?\" the lieutenant asked, obviously not recognizing him.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When did you last see him and where?\"\n\n\"I saw him for a short time in Rome, just before he went to Sicily.\"\n\n\"And did you hear from him when he was in Sicily?\"\n\nThe lieutenant was writing it all down in the notebook that he had taken from his brown case.\n\n\"No, I didn\'t hear from him.\"\n\n\"You did not know when you were in Rome that the police wanted to see you?\"\n\n\"No, I did not know that. I cannot understand why people think I am missing.\"\n\n\"Mr. Greenleaf did not tell you in Rome that the police wanted to speak to you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Mr. Ripley, where have you been since the end of November?\"\n\n\"I have been traveling. I have been mostly in the north of Italy.\" Tom made a mistake here and there, and his Italian sounded quite different from Dickie\'s.\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Milan, Torino, Faenza.\"\n\n\"We have searched the hotels in Milan and Faenza. Did you stay all the time with friends? \"\n\n\"No, I - slept quite often in my car.\" It was obvious he didn\'t have much money, Tom thought.\n\n\"May I see your passport?\"\n\nTom pulled it out of his inside jacket pocket. The lieutenant studied the picture closely, while Tom waited with the slightly anxious look, the firmly open lips, of the passport photograph. The lieutenant looked quickly at the few marks that only partly filled the first two pages of the passport.\n\n\"You have been in Italy since October 2?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nThe lieutenant smiled, a pleasant Italian smile now, and leaned forward. \"Well, that settles one important matter - the mystery of the San Remo boat.\"\n\nTom frowned. \"What is that?\"\n\n\"A boat was found sunk there with some stains that were believed to be blood. Naturally, when you were missing, or we thought you were missing, immediately after San Remo - We thought it might be a good idea to ask Mr. Greenleaf what had happened to you. We did that. The boat was missed the same day that you two were in San Remo.\"\n\nTom pretended not to see the joke.\n\n\"Did you also know Frederick Miles?\" the lieutenant asked.\n\n\"No, I only met him once when he was getting off the bus in Mongibello. I never saw him again.\"\n\n\"Ah-hah.\" The lieutenant was silent.\n\n\"I have read in a newspaper that the police may believe that Mr. Greenleaf is guilty of the murder of Freddie Miles if he does not speak to them. Is it true that they think he is guilty?\"\n\n\"Ah, no, no, no!\" the lieutenant protested. \"But it is important that he comes forward! Why is he hiding himself? You have absolutely no idea where Mr. Greenleaf might be at this moment?\"\n\n\"No, absolutely no.\"\n\n\"Mr. Greenleaf and Mr. Miles didn\'t have an argument that you know of? \"\n\n\"I don\'t know, but - \"\n\n\"What about the girl, Marjorie Sherwood?\"\n\n\"I suppose it is possible,\" Tom said, \"but I do not think so.\"\n\nTom waited, silent. The lieutenant was waiting for him to say something more. Tom felt quite comfortable now. He felt suddenly innocent and strong.\n\n\"Do you think they had an argument, Mr. Miles and Mr. Greenleaf, about Miss Sherwood?\"\n\n\"I cannot say. It is possible. I know that Mr. Miles was very fond of her, too.\"\n\nHis story painted a picture of Dickie as an unhappy lover, Tom thought, not willing to let Marge go to Cortina to have some fun, because she liked Freddie Miles too much.\n\n\"Do you think Dickie is running away from something, or do you think it is an accident that you cannot find him?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. This is too much. First, the matter of the checks. He denied the false signatures, but when the bank wishes to see him and also the police in Rome wish to see him about the murder of his friend, and he suddenly disappears -\"\n\nThe lieutenant threw out his hands. \"That can only mean that he is running away from us.\" The lieutenant stood up. \"Well, thank you so much for your help, Mr. Ripley. I hope we can find you more easily the next time we have questions to ask you.\"\n\n\"If you like I shall keep in touch with you in Rome so you will always know where I am. I am as much interested as you in finding my friend.\"\n\nThe lieutenant handed him a card with his name and the address of his station in Rome. \"Thank you, Mr. Ripley. Good day.\" The younger policeman waved to him as he went out, and Tom said goodbye and quietly closed the door.\n\nHe felt like flying - like a bird, out of the window, with spread arms! The fools! All around the thing and never guessing it! Never guessing that Dickie was running from the signature questions because he wasn\'t Dickie Greenleaf at all!\n\nTonight he was going to have a wonderful dinner. And look out at the moonlight on the water. He was suddenly very hungry. He was going to have something delicious and expensive to eat.\n\nHe had a bright idea while he was changing his clothes: he ought to have an envelope hidden in his suitcase, with a note on it saying that it should not be opened for several months. Inside it should be a will signed by Dickie, leaving Tom his money and his income. That was an idea!', 1, 1, 0, '', 30876, 11701),
(30879, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 9\n\nA Visit from Marge\n\nVenice February 28\n\nDear Mr. Greenleaf:\n\nI thought I ought to write you with whatever personal information I have about Richard, since I was one of the last people, it seems, who saw him.\n\nI saw him in Rome around February 2 at the Inghilterra Hotel. As you know, this was only two or three days after the death of Freddie Miles. I found Dickie upset and nervous. He said he was going to Palermo as soon as the police finished questioning him about Freddie\'s death, and he seemed eager to get away. I wanted to tell you that there was a certain unhappiness under all this that troubled me much more than his obvious nervousness. I had the feeling that he would try to do something violent - perhaps to himself.\n\nI believe it is possible that Richard has killed himself. At the time of writing he has not been found. I certainly hope he will be before this reaches you. This is a sad message to send you and I regret it. I thought it my duty to write you this...\n\n\n\n\nMunich March 3\n\nDear Tom\n\nThanks for your letter. It was very kind of you. I\'ve answered the police in writing, and one came up to see me. I won\'t be coming by Venice, but thanks for your invitation. I am going to Rome the day after tomorrow to meet Dickie\'s father, who is flying over. Yes, I agree with you that it was a good idea for you to write to him.\n\nI did want to say to you that I don\'t agree with you at all that Dickie would commit suicide. He just isn\'t the type. I know you\'re going to say people never act like they\'re going to do it. But no, not Dickie. Maybe he was murdered in a back street in Naples - or even Rome. I can also imagine him running out on duties. I think that\'s what he\'s doing now.\n\nNice to know your address finally. Thanks again for your letter, your advice, and invitations.\n\nBest, Marge\n\n\n\nShe had decided to be friends with him, Tom supposed. She\'d probably changed her attitude about him to the police, too.\n\nDickie\'s disappearance was causing a lot of interest in the Italian newspapers. Marge, or somebody, had provided reporters with photographs. There were pictures of Dickie sailing his boat in Mongibello, pictures of Dickie on a beach, and a picture of Dickie and Marge. One of the articles mentioned that \"Mr. Ripley, one of the wealthy young American visitors in Italy, now lives in a palace looking out on San Marco in Venice.\"\n\nThat pleased Tom most of all. He cut out and saved that article.\n\nHe was now so confident that he even wrote Aunt Dottie with a calm, loving attitude that he had never wanted to use before, or had never before been able to use. He asked about her health and her little group of nasty friends in Boston. After he had finished the letter, he typed Dickie\'s will, leaving him his income and the money he had in various banks, and signed it Richard Greenleaf. The signature was perfect, exactly like the thin, confusing signature on Dickie\'s passport. Tom practiced for half an hour before he signed the will, relaxed his hands, then signed a piece of paper, then the will, in rapid order. Tom put an envelope into the typewriter and addressed it to \"To Whom It May Concern,\" with a note that it shouldn\'t be opened until June of this year. He placed it in a side pocket of his suitcase to suggest that he had been carrying it there for some time and hadn\'t bothered unpacking it when he moved into the house.\n\n***\n\nAbout ten days after Marge\'s letter, Tom began to worry because Mr. Greenleaf hadn\'t written or telephoned him from Rome. He sometimes imagined that the police had told Mr. Greenleaf that they were playing a game with Tom Ripley, and had asked Mr. Greenleaf not to talk to him.\n\nEach day he looked eagerly in his mailbox for a letter from Marge or Mr. Greenleaf. His house was ready for their arrival. His answers to their questions were ready in his head. Tom wanted to take a trip, the famous trip to Greece. He had bought a travel book about Greece, and he had already planned his journey through the islands, but he couldn\'t go until something happened.\n\nThen, on the morning of April 4, he got a telephone call from Marge. She was in Venice at the railroad station.\n\n***\n\n\"I\'ll come and pick you up!\" Tom said cheerfully. \"Is Mr. Greenleaf with you?\"\n\n\"No, he\'s in Rome. I\'m alone. You don\'t have to pick me up.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" Tom said, wanting something to do at last. \"You\'ll never find the house by yourself.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will. It\'s next to della Salute, isn\'t it? I take a boat from San Marco\'s.\"\n\nShe was right. \"Well, if you really want to come alone.\" He had just thought that he had better take one more good look around the house before she got there.\" Have you had lunch?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Good! We\'ll lunch together somewhere.\"\n\nThey hung up. He walked seriously and slowly through the house, into both large rooms upstairs, down the stairs, and through the living room. Nothing, anywhere, that belonged to Dickie. He hoped the house didn\'t look too upper class.\n\nTom made two drinks and arranged the glasses and a plate of snacks on a small table in the living room. When he heard a knock, he went to the door and swung it open.\n\n\"Marge! Good to see you! Come in!\" He took the suitcase from her hand.\n\n\"How are you, Tom? Is all this yours?\" She looked around her, and up at the high ceiling.\n\n\"I rented it very cheaply,\" Tom said quickly \"Come and have a drink. Tell me what\'s new. You\'ve been talking to the police in Rome?\" He carried her overcoat and her raincoat to a chair.\n\n\"Yes, and to Mr. Greenleaf. He\'s very upset - naturally.\" She sat down on a sofa.\n\nTom sat opposite her. \"Have they found anything new? One of the officers there has been keeping me informed, but he hasn\'t told me anything that really matters.\"\n\n\"Well, they found out that Dickie cashed over a thousand dollars\' worth of travelers\' checks before he left Palermo, just before. Maybe he went somewhere with it, like Greece or Africa. Certainly he didn\'t go off to kill himself after just cashing a thousand dollars, anyway.\"\n\n\"No,\" Tom agreed. \"Well, that sounds hopeful. I didn\'t see that in the papers.\"\n\n\"I don\'t think they put it in.\"\n\n\"How is Mr. Greenleaf?\"\n\nMarge shook her head. \"I feel so sorry for him. He keeps saying the American police could do a better job and all that, and he doesn\'t know any Italian, so that makes it twice as bad.\"\n\n\"What\'s he doing in Rome?\"\n\n\"Waiting. What can any of us do?\"\n\nTom drank his drink slowly while he thought. \"I certainly didn\'t mean to upset anybody when I said what I did about Dickie\'s sadness. I felt it was kind of a duty to tell you and Mr. Greenleaf.\"\n\n\"I understand. No, I think you were right to tell us. I just don\'t think it\'s true.\" She smiled, her eyes shining with a belief that struck Tom as completely crazy.\n\nDuring lunch, Marge asked him more questions than any police officer about Dickie\'s feelings while he was in Rome. Tom was questioned about everything from Di Massimo, the painter Dickie had worked with, to Dickie\'s eating habits and the hour he got up in the morning.\n\n\"How do you think he felt about me? Tell me honestly. I can take it.\"\n\n\"I think he was worried about you,\" Tom said seriously. \"I think - well, it was one of those situations that happen quite often, a man who\'s afraid of marriage to begin with-\"\n\n\"But I never asked him to marry me! \" Marge protested.\n\n\"I know, but -\" Tom forced himself to continue, though the subject was sour in his mouth. \"Let\'s say he couldn\'t face the responsibility of you caring so much about him. I think he wanted a less complicated relationship with you.\" That told her everything and nothing.\n\nThey were silent a few minutes, then Tom asked her about her life and work. Marge answered very enthusiastically. Tom had the feeling that if she had Dickie back she would probably just explode with happiness, make a loud, attractive pop! And that would be the end of her.\n\n\"Do you think I should offer to talk to Mr. Greenleaf, too?\" Tom asked. \"I\'d be glad to go to Rome -\" but he wouldn\'t be so glad, he remembered, because Rome had simply too many people in it who had seen him as Dickie Greenleaf. \"Or do you think he\'d like to come here?\"\n\n\"I think it\'d be nice if you called him. I\'ll write the address down for you.\"\n\n\"That\'s a good idea. He doesn\'t like me, does he?\" Marge smiled a little. \"Well, to be honest, no. I think he thinks you used Dickie, to your advantage.\"\n\n\"Well, I didn\'t. I\'m sorry the idea didn\'t work about my getting Dickie back home, but I explained all of that. I wrote him the nicest letter I could about Dickie when I heard he was missing. Didn\'t that help? \"\n\n\"I think it did, but - Oh, I\'m terribly sorry, Tom! All over this wonderful tablecloth!\" Marge had turned her drink over. She wiped at the tablecloth rapidly.\n\nTom came running back from the kitchen with a wet cloth. \"Perfectly all right,\" he said, watching the wood of the table turn white in spite of his wiping. It wasn\'t the tablecloth he cared about, it was the beautiful table.\n\n\"I\'m so sorry,\" Marge went on protesting.\n\nTom hated her. He suddenly remembered her bra hanging over the window in Mongibello. Her underwear would be hanging over his chairs tonight, if he invited her to stay here. The idea disgusted him. He forced himself to smile across the table at her. \"I hope you\'ll honor me by accepting a bed for the night. Not mine,\" he added, laughing, \"but I\'ve got two rooms upstairs and you\'re welcome to one of them.\"\n\n\"Thanks a lot. All right, I will.\" She smiled broadly at him.\n\nTom called Mr. Greenleaf from a public telephone at about seven o\'clock. Mr. Greenleaf sounded friendlier than Tom had expected, and sadly hungry for any information about Dickie.\n\n\"I\'ve told Marge all I know,\" Tom said, \"so she\'ll be able to tell you anything I\'ve forgotten. I\'m only sorry that I can\'t provide anything of real importance for the police to work on.\"\n\n\"These police!\" Mr. Greenleaf said angrily. \"I\'m beginning to think Richard is dead. For some reason the Italians don\'t want to admit he might be.\"\n\nTom was shocked at Mr. Greenleaf\'s honesty about Dickie\'s possible death.\n\n\"Do you really think Dickie\'s killed himself, Mr. Greenleaf?\" Tom asked quietly.\n\nMr. Greenleaf thought about it for a minute. \"I don\'t know. I think it\'s possible, yes. I never thought much of my son\'s mental health, Tom.\"\n\n\"I\'m afraid I agree with you,\" Tom said. \"Would you like to talk to Marge? She\'s here with me.\"\n\n\"No, no, thanks. When\'s she coming back? \"\n\n\"I think she said she\'d be going back to Rome tomorrow. If you\'d like to come to Venice, just for a slight rest, Mr. Greenleaf, you\'re welcome to stay at my house.\"\n\nBut Mr. Greenleaf refused the invitation.\n\nTom and Marge walked to a restaurant. Marge was in the mood to talk and that annoyed Tom through their long dinner, but he made an enormous effort not to get angry. The worst was coming later tonight, Tom thought: the boat ride.\n\nMarge wanted a private boat, of course, not the regular service that took people over from San Marco\'s to the steps of Santa Maria della Salute. It was one-thirty in the morning. He felt exhausted and lay back in the boat\'s seat as lazily as Marge, careful to keep his leg from touching hers.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30878, 11701),
(30881, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 10\n\nThe Arrival of Mr. Greenleaf\n\nTom was awakened very early the next morning by a banging on his door. He grabbed his pants and went down. It was a telegram, and he had to run back upstairs to get a tip for the man. He stood in the cold living room and read it: CHANGED MY MIND. WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU. ARRIVING 11:45 A.M. H. GREENLEAF.\n\nTom shook with fear. Well, he had expected it, he thought. But he hadn\'t really. He wasn\'t looking forward to it.\n\nHe ran upstairs and got back into his warm bed to try to catch some more sleep. He kept wondering if Marge would come in or knock on his door because she had heard that loud knock, but he finally decided that she had slept through it. He imagined greeting Mr. Greenleaf at the door, shaking his hand firmly, and he tried to imagine his questions, but his mind was too tired and that made him feel frightened and uncomfortable.\n\nMarge and Tom went to the railroad station to meet Mr. Greenleaf at eleven forty-five. It was raining, and so windy and cold that the rain felt like ice on their faces. Finally there was Mr. Greenleaf, serious and gray. Marge rushed forward to kiss him on the cheek, and he smiled at her.\n\n\"Hello, Tom,\" he said loudly, putting out his hand. \"How\'re you?\"\n\n\"Very well, sir. And you?\" Tom suggested they go straight to his house, but Mr. Greenleaf wanted to go to a hotel first.\n\n\"I\'ll come over as soon as I check in. I thought I\'d try the Gritti. Is that anywhere near your place? \" Mr. Greenleaf asked.\n\n\"Not too close, but you can walk to San Marco\'s and take a boat over,\" Tom said. \"We\'ll come with you, if you want, if you just want to check in. I thought we could all have lunch together - unless you\'d rather see Marge by yourself first.\" He was the old Ripley again.\n\n\"Came here mainly to talk to you,\" Mr. Greenleaf said.\n\n\"Is there any news?\" Marge asked.\n\nMr. Greenleaf shook his head. He was looking around nervously. He hadn\'t answered Tom\'s question about lunch. Tom folded his arms, put a pleasant look on his face, and didn\'t try to talk any more. Mr. Greenleaf and Marge were talking very quietly about some people they knew in Rome. Tom observed that Marge and Mr. Greenleaf were very friendly, though Marge had said she had not known him before she met him in Rome.\n\nAt lunch, Mr. Greenleaf talked a little more, but his face kept its serious look, and he still looked around as he spoke, clearly hoping that Dickie would come walking in at any moment. The police hadn\'t found anything that could be called a clue, he said, and he had just arranged for an American private detective to come over and try to solve the mystery.\n\nThis made Tom swallow thoughtfully - he, too, believed that American detectives were better than the Italians.\n\nThe questions, Tom thought, would come at the house, probably when he and Mr. Greenleaf were alone. He knew Mr. Greenleaf wanted to talk to him alone, and therefore he suggested coffee at the restaurant where they were before Marge could suggest having it at home. But Marge sat around with them in the living room for half an hour after they got back. Finally Tom frowned at her and looked at the stairs and she got the message, put her hand over her mouth, and announced that she was going up to have a short rest.\n\n\"Well, Tom,\" Mr. Greenleaf began heavily, \" this is a strange end, isn\'t it? \"\n\n\"End?\"\n\n\"Well, you living in Europe now, and Richard - \"\n\n\"None of us has suggested yet that he might be back in America,\" Tom said pleasantly.\n\n\"No. That couldn\'t be. The officials in America have been watching for him.\" Mr. Greenleaf continued to walk, not looking at him. \"Where do you really think he may be? \"\n\n\"Well, sir, he could be hiding in Italy - very easily, if he doesn\'t use a hotel where he has to sign in.\"\n\n\"Are there any hotels in Italy where one doesn\'t have to sign in?\"\n\n\"No, not officially. But anyone who knows Italian as well as Dickie might manage it.\"\n\n\"And is that your idea of what he may be doing?\" Mr. Greenleaf looked at him suddenly, and Tom saw that sad expression he had noticed on the first evening he had met him.\n\n\"No, I - It\'s possible. That\'s all I can say about it.\" He paused. \"I\'m sorry to say it, Mr. Greenleaf, but I think there\'s a real possibility that Dickie is dead.\"\n\nMr. Greenleaf\'s look didn\'t change. \"Because of that sadness you mentioned in Rome? What exactly did he say to you?\"\n\n\"It was his general mood,\" Tom said. \"The Miles thing had obviously upset him. He\'s the sort of man - He really does hate attention of any kind, violence of any kind.\" Tom bit his lips. \"He did say that if one more thing happened, he would just go crazy - or he didn\'t know what he would do.\"\n\n\"I\'m afraid I don\'t agree with you that Richard committed suicide,\" Mr. Greenleaf said.\n\n\"Well, neither does Marge. I just said it\'s a possibility. I don\'t even think it\'s the most likely thing that\'s happened.\"\n\n\"You don\'t? What do you think is? \"\n\n\"That he\'s hiding,\" Tom said. \"You know he could be in several other countries besides Italy, too. Perhaps he went to Greece or France or anywhere else after he got back to Naples, because no one was looking for him until days later.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" Mr. Greenleaf said tiredly.\n\nLater that evening, Tom and Marge called Mr. Greenleaf at his hotel. It was still early for dinner, so they had drinks at a cafe in a street near Mr. Greenleaf\'s hotel. Tom tried hard to be pleasant and to talk in a friendly manner during dinner. Mr. Greenleaf was in a good mood, because he had just telephoned his wife and found her in very good spirits and feeling much better.\n\nIt was a quiet dinner. Tom told a clean, slightly funny joke, and Marge laughed loudly. Mr. Greenleaf refused to let Tom pay for the dinner, and then he said he was going back to his hotel because he didn\'t feel too good. He was going back to Rome tomorrow, and Marge decided to go with him. They walked back to the hotel and said goodnight.\n\n\"I\'m very sorry I wasn\'t able to spend more time with you,\" Tom said.\n\n\"So am I, my boy. Maybe some other time.\" Mr. Greenleaf touched his shoulder.\n\nTom walked back home with Marge in a kind of fog of happiness. It had all gone very well, Tom thought. Marge talked to him as they walked, laughing because she had broken her bra and had to hold it up with one hand, she said.\n\nTom was thinking of the letter he had received from Bob Delancey this afternoon, the first letter he had received from Bob in many weeks. Tom had lived in a room in Bob\'s house before leaving New York. In the letter, Bob said that the police had questioned everybody in his house about an income tax crime of a few months ago. The criminal, it seemed, had used Bob\'s address to receive his checks, and had gotten the checks by the simple means of taking the letters out of the mailbox, where the mailman had put them. The mailman had been questioned, too, Bob had said, and remembered the name George McAlpin on the letters. Bob seemed to think it was rather funny. The mystery was, who took the letters addressed to George McAlpin?\n\nIt was a very comforting letter for Tom. That income tax situation had been worrying him because he had known the police would find out about it at some time. He was glad the wait had ended. He couldn\'t imagine how the police would ever, could ever, connect Tom Ripley with George McAlpin.\n\nHe sat down in the living room to read Bob\'s letter again when he got home. Marge had gone upstairs to pack her things and to go to bed. Tom was tired, too, but the freedom of tomorrow, when Marge and Mr. Greenleaf would be gone, was a pleasant thought. He took his shoes off so he could put his feet up on the sofa, lay back on a pillow, and continued reading Bob\'s letter.\n\n\"The police think it\'s somebody who came by occasionally to pick up his mail, because none of the people in this house look like criminals... How are the girls in Venice? How long are you staying there anyway?\"\n\nForever, Tom thought. Maybe he\'d never go back to the States. It wasn\'t really Europe itself that made him feel this way, but the evenings he had spent alone, here and in Rome. Evenings by himself simply looking at maps, or lying around on sofas going through travel books. Evenings looking at the clothes - his clothes and Dickie\'s - and feeling Dickie\'s rings, and running his fingers over the suitcase he had bought at Gucci\'s.\n\nHe loved objects, not mountains of them, but a certain few that he wanted to keep. They gave a man respect for himself. The things he possessed reminded him that he existed, and made him enjoy his life. It was as simple as that. He existed. Dickie\'s money gave him the opportunity to see Greece, to collect whatever he wanted, to join art societies if he cared to, and to give money to their work.\n\nHe thought he might rest, then read some of his book, whatever the hour. He felt warm and sleepy, in spite of the coffee he had drunk. The edge of the sofa fitted his shoulders like somebody\'s arm, or better than somebody\'s arm. He decided he would spend the night here. It was more comfortable than the sofa upstairs. In a few minutes he might go up and get a blanket.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30880, 11701);

(30883, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 11\n\nDickie\'s Rings\n\n\"Tom?\"\n\nHe opened his eyes. Marge was coming down the stairs. Tom sat up. She had his brown leather box in her hand.\n\n\"I just found Dickie\'s rings in here,\" she said as if she was having trouble breathing.\n\n\"Oh. He gave them to me. To take care of.\" Tom stood up.\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"In Rome, I think.\" He took a step back and picked up one of his shoes, mostly in an effort to seem calm.\n\n\"What was he going to do? Why\'d he give them to you?\"\n\nShe\'d been looking for a needle to sew her bra, Tom thought. Why hadn\'t he put the rings somewhere else, like in an inside pocket of that suitcase? \"I don\'t really know,\" Tom said. \"A moment of stupidity or something. You know how he is. He said if anything ever happened to him, he wanted me to have his rings.\"\n\nMarge looked confused. \"Where was he going? \"\n\n\"To Palermo.\" He was holding the shoe in both hands, in a position to use it as a weapon. A plan went quickly through his head: hit her with the shoe, then drag her out by the front door, and drop her into the water. He\'d say shed fallen, slipped on the rocks. And she was such a good swimmer, he\'d thought she could save herself.\n\nMarge stared down at the box. \"Then he was going to kill himself.\"\n\n\"Yes - if you want to look at it that way, the rings - They make it look more likely that he did.\"\n\n\"Why didn\'t you say anything about it before?\"\n\n\"I think I absolutely forgot them. I put them away so they wouldn\'t get lost and I never thought of looking at them since the day he gave them to me.\"\n\n\"He either killed himself or changed his identity - didn\'t he?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Tom said it sadly and firmly.\n\n\"You\'d better tell Mr. Greenleaf.\"\n\n\"Yes, I will. Mr. Greenleaf and the police.\"\n\n\"I think we\'re getting closer to the truth,\" Marge said.\n\nTom was twisting the shoe in his hands like a pair of gloves now, but still keeping it in position, because Marge was staring at him in a funny way. She was still thinking. Was she playing games with him? Did she know now?\n\nMarge said seriously, \"I just can\'t imagine Dickie ever being without his rings,\" and Tom knew then that she hadn\'t guessed the answer.\n\nHe relaxed and sank down on the sofa and pretended to busy himself with putting on his shoes.\n\n\"No,\" he agreed, automatically.\n\n\"If it weren\'t so late, I\'d call Mr. Greenleaf now. He\'s probably in bed, and he wouldn\'t sleep all night if I told him, I know.\"\n\n\"I\'m sorry I didn\'t mention it sooner,\" he said. \"It was just one of those - \"\n\n\"Yes, it makes it kind of silly at this point for Mr. Greenleaf to bring a private detective over, doesn\'t it?\" Her voice shook.\n\nTom looked at her. She was going to cry. This was the first moment, Tom realized, that she was admitting to herself that Dickie could be dead, that he probably was dead. Tom went toward her slowly. \"I\'m sorry, Marge. I\'m really sorry that I didn\'t tell you sooner about the rings.\"\n\nHe put his arm around her. He almost had to, because she was leaning against him.\n\n***\n\nMarge called Mr. Greenleaf at eight-thirty the next morning to ask how soon they could come over to his hotel. But Mr. Greenleaf probably noticed that she was upset. Tom heard her starting to tell him the story of the rings. She used the same words that Tom had used to her about the rings - obviously Marge had believed him - but Tom couldn\'t tell what Mr. Greenleaf\'s reaction was.\n\n\"What did he say?\" Tom asked when Marge had hung up.\n\nMarge sat down tiredly on a chair across the room.\n\n\"He seems to feel the way I do. He said it himself. It seems that Dickie meant to kill himself.\"\n\nTom sat up on the edge of the sofa and loosened his tie. He had slept in his clothes on the sofa, and Marge had awakened him when she had come down a few minutes ago. He felt awful. He stood up suddenly. \"I\'m going upstairs to wash,\" he called to Marge.\n\nTom undressed in the room next to Marge\'s, then went into the bathroom and turned on the shower. After a look at himself in the mirror he decided to shave first, and he went back to the room to get his electric razor which he had removed from the bathroom for no particular reason when Marge had arrived. On the way back he heard the telephone ring. Marge answered it. Tom leaned over the stairs, listening.\n\n\"Oh, that\'s fine,\" she said. \"Oh, that doesn\'t matter if we don\'t... Yes, I\'ll tell him... All right, we\'ll hurry. Tom\'s just washing up... Oh, less than an hour. Bye-bye.\"\n\nHe heard her walking toward the stairs, and he stepped back because he wasn\'t dressed.\n\n\"Tom?\" she called up. \"The detective from America just got here! He just called Mr. Greenleaf and he\'s coming from the airport!\"\n\n\"Fine!\" Tom called back. He turned the shower off, and picked up his razor. He would be glad when she was gone, and he hoped she left this morning. Unless she and Mr. Greenleaf decided to see what the detective was going to do with him. Tom knew that the detective had come to Venice especially to see him. If he hadn\'t, he would have waited to see Mr. Greenleaf in Rome. Tom wondered if Marge realized that too. Probably she didn\'t.\n\nTom and Marge took the boat to San Marco and then walked to Mr. Greenleaf\'s hotel. They telephoned up to Mr. Greenleaf\'s room. Mr. Greenleaf said that Mr. McCarron was there, and asked them to come up.\n\nMr. Greenleaf opened his door for them. \"Good morning,\" he said. He pressed Marge\'s arm like a father.\n\n\"Tom -\"\n\nTom came in behind Marge. The detective was standing by the window, a short, fat man of about thirty-five. His face looked friendly but serious.\n\n\"This is Alvin McCarron,\" Mr. Greenleaf said. \"Miss Sherwood and Mr. Ripley.\"\n\n\"I understand you\'re a friend of Richard\'s?\" he asked.\n\n\"We both are,\" Tom said.\n\n\"Do you have the rings?\" McCarron asked, looking from Tom to Marge.\n\n\"Yes,\" Marge said seriously, getting up. She took the rings from her purse and gave them to McCarron.\n\nMcCarron turned to Tom. \"When did he give them to you?\"\n\n\"In Rome. As close as I can remember, around February 3, just a few days after the murder of Freddie Miles,\" Tom answered.\n\n\"What did he say when he gave them to you? \"\n\n\"He said that if anything happened to him, he wanted me to have them. I asked him what he thought was going to happen to him. He said he didn\'t know, but something might.\" Tom paused on purpose. \"He didn\'t seem more upset at that particular moment than a lot of other times. I\'d talked to him, so it didn\'t enter my mind that he was going to kill himself. I knew he planned to go away, that was all.\"\n\n\"Where?\" asked the detective.\n\n\"To Palermo,\" Tom said. He looked at Marge. \"I\'m quite certain he gave them to me the day you spoke to me in Rome - at the Inghilterra. That day or the day before. Do you remember the date?\"\n\n\"February 2,\" Marge said in a quiet voice.\n\n\"What else?\" McCarron asked Tom. \"What time of day was it? Had he been drinking?\"\n\n\"No. He drinks very little. I think it was early afternoon. He said it would be better if I didn\'t mention the rings to anybody, and of course I agreed. I put the rings away and completely forgot about them, as I told Miss Sherwood - I suppose because I\'d told myself so strongly that he didn\'t want me to say anything about them.\"\n\n\"What did you do with the rings?\"\n\n\"I put them in an old box that I have - just a little box I keep odd buttons in.\"\n\nMcCarron looked at him for a moment in silence. Out of that calm but bright Irish face could come anything, a difficult question, a direct statement that he was lying. In his mind, Tom concentrated on his own facts, determined to defend them to his death. In the silence, Tom could hear Marge\'s breathing, and a cough from Mr. Greenleaf almost made him jump. Mr. Greenleaf looked very calm, almost bored. Tom wondered if he had fixed up some plan with McCarron against him, based on the rings story?\n\n\"Did he have any enemies that you know of?\" McCarron asked.\n\n\"Absolutely none,\" Tom said. \"I\'ve thought of that.\"\n\n\"Any reason you can think of why he might want to hide, or take another identity?\"\n\nTom said carefully, \"Possibly - but it\'s almost impossible in Europe. He\'d need a different passport. Any country he wanted to enter, he would have to have a passport. He\'d need one even to get into a hotel.\"\n\n\"Well, how do you see it, Mr. Ripley?\"\n\nMcCarron wasn\'t nearly finished, Tom thought. McCarron was going to see him alone later. \"I\'m afraid I agree with Miss Sherwood that it appears that he\'s killed himself. I\'ve said that before to Mr. Greenleaf.\"\n\n\"When was the last time you saw him, Miss Sherwood?\"\n\n\"On November 23, when he left for San Remo,\" Marge said quickly.\n\n\"You were then in Mongibello?\" McCarron asked.\n\n\"Yes,\" Marge said. \"I just missed seeing him in Rome in February, but the last time I saw him was in Mongibello.\"\n\n\"He was trying to avoid everyone in Rome,\" Tom added. \"That\'s why, when he first gave me the rings, I thought he had some idea of getting away from everyone he had known, living in another city, and just being alone for a time.\"\n\n\"Why, do you think? \"\n\nTom explained, mentioning the murder of his friend Freddie Miles and its effect on Dickie.\n\n\"Do you think Richard knew who killed Freddie Miles?\"\n\n\"No, I certainly don\'t.\"\n\n\"Think a minute,\" McCarron said to Tom. \"Do you think that might explain his behavior? Do you think he\'s avoiding answering the police by hiding out now? \"\n\nTom thought for a minute. \"He didn\'t give me a single reason to think that.\"\n\n\"Do you think Dickie was afraid of something? \"\n\n\"I can\'t imagine of what,\" Tom said.\n\nMcCarron was staring at Tom, but whether he was considering his honesty or thinking over all they had said to him, Tom couldn\'t tell. McCarron looked like a typical salesman, Tom thought. He didn\'t think too much of him, but, on the other hand, it wasn\'t wise to ignore your enemy. McCarron\'s small, soft mouth opened as Tom watched him, and he said, \"Would you mind coming downstairs with me, Mr. Ripley, if you\'ve still got a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" Tom said, standing up.\n\n\"We won\'t be long,\" McCarron said to Mr. Greenleaf and Marge.\n\nThey walked toward the elevator. Was this the way they did it? Tom wondered. A quiet word alone. He would be handed over to the Italian police, and then Mr. McCarron would return to the room just as he had promised. Tom turned to McCarron as the elevator stopped, and said seriously, showing his teeth in a smile, \" Is this your first trip to Venice? \"\n\n\"Yes,\" said McCarron. He passed by the hotel desk. \"Shall we go right in here?\" He pointed at the coffee bar. He spoke very politely.\n\n\"All right,\" Tom agreed. Would McCarron accuse him in a place like this, quietly laying down fact after fact on the table? He took the chair that McCarron pulled out for him. McCarron sat with his back to the wall.\n\nMcCarron looked at him. His small mouth smiled on one side. Tom imagined three or four different beginnings: \"You killed Richard, didn\'t you? The rings are just too much, aren\'t they?\" Or \"Tell me about the San Remo boat, Mr. Ripley, in detail.\" Or simply leading up quietly, \"Where were you on February 15, when Richard landed in... Naples? All right, but where were you living then? Where were you living in January, for example?... Can you prove it? \"\n\nMcCarron was saying nothing at all, only looking down at his fat hands now, and smiling weakly.\n\nTom heard himself speaking, in an amazingly calm voice. \"Did you have time to speak to Lieutenant Roverini when you came through Rome?\" As he asked it, he realized that he wanted information: to find out if McCarron had heard about the San Remo boat.\n\n\"No, I didn\'t,\" McCarron said. \"How would you describe Richard\'s character?\"\n\n\"He wanted to be a painter,\" Tom began, \"but he knew he\'d never be a very good painter. He tried to pretend he didn\'t care, and that he was perfectly happy and leading exactly the kind of life he wanted to lead over here in Europe.\" Tom wet his lips. \"But I think he was beginning to get depressed. His father didn\'t like his lifestyle, as you probably know. And Dickie had gotten himself into a difficult situation with Marge.\"\n\n\"How do you mean? \"\n\n\"Marge was in love with him, and he wasn\'t with her, and at the same time he was seeing her so much in Mongibello, she kept on hoping -\"\n\nTom began to feel on safer ground, but he pretended to have difficulty in expressing himself. \"He never actually discussed it with me. He always spoke very highly of Marge. He was very fond of her, but it was obvious to everybody - Marge, too - that he would never marry her. But Marge never quite gave up. I think that\'s the main reason Dickie left Mongibello.\"\n\n\"What do you mean never gave up? What did she do?\"\n\n\"She kept writing to him, wanting to see him. He wanted to be by himself. Particularly after the Miles murder, he wasn\'t in the mood to see Marge, and he was afraid that she\'d come up to Rome from Mongibello when she heard of all the trouble he was in.\"\n\n\"Why do you think he was nervous after the Miles murder? Do you think Richard killed Freddie? \"\n\n\"No, I don\'t. I never thought of it. I don\'t know what kind of people are likely to kill somebody. I\'ve seen him angry - \"\n\n\"When?\"\n\nTom described the two days in Rome when Dickie, he said, had been angry and frustrated because of the police questioning, and had actually moved out of his apartment to avoid phone calls from friends and strangers. Tom also talked again about the growing frustration in Dickie, because he had not been progressing as he had wanted to in his painting. He described Dickie as a proud young man who was determined to ignore his father\'s wishes. \"If he killed himself,\" Tom said, \"I think it was because he realized certain failures in himself. It\'s much easier for me to imagine him as a suicide than a murderer.\"\n\n\"But I\'m not so sure that he didn\'t kill Freddie Miles. Are you?\"\n\nMcCarron was perfectly sincere. Tom was sure of that. McCarron was even expecting him to defend Dickie now, because they had been friends. Tom felt some of the terror leaving him, but only some of it, like something melting very slowly inside him. \"I\'m not sure,\" Tom said, \"but I just don\'t believe that he did.\"\n\n\"I\'m not sure either. But it would explain a lot, wouldn\'t it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Tom said. \"Everything.\"\n\n***\n\nMcCarron called the next day from Rome, wanting the names of everyone Dickie had known in Mongibello. Most of the names Marge had already given him, but Tom went through them all.\n\n\"Well, I guess that\'s about all. Thanks very much, Mr. Ripley.\"\n\n\"You\'re very welcome. Good luck.\"\n\nThen Tom waited quietly in his house for several days, just as anybody would do if the search for a missing friend had reached its most serious point.\n\nOn the evening of the sixth day after Mr. Greenleaf and McCarron had left, Tom called Mr. Greenleaf in Rome. He had nothing new to report, but Tom hadn\'t expected anything. Marge had gone back to the United States.\n\nMr. Greenleaf said he would be leaving at the end of the week, travelling first to Paris, where the French police were also carrying on the search. McCarron was going with him, and if nothing happened in Paris they were both going home. \"It\'s obvious to me or to anybody,\" Mr. Greenleaf said, \"that he\'s either dead or hiding from us. There\'s not a corner of the world where the search for him hasn\'t been written about in the newspapers.\"', 1, 1, 0, '', 30882, 11701),
(30885, 'The Talented Mr Ripley by Patricia Highsmith\n\nPart 12\n\nTom Ripley\'s Heroic Journey\n\nVenice June 3\n\nDear Mr. Greenleaf:\n\nWhile packing a suitcase today, I found an envelope that Richard gave me in Rome, and which for some reason I had forgotten until now. On the envelope is written, \"Not to be opened until June\" and, as it happens, it is June. The envelope contains Richard\'s will, and he leaves his income and everything else to me. I am shocked by this, as you probably are, but he seemed to know what he was writing.\n\nI am only very sorry I did not remember having the envelope. If I had, it would have proven much earlier that Dickie planned to kill himself. I put it into a suitcase pocket, and then I forgot it. He gave it to me on the last occasion I saw him, in Rome, when he was so depressed.\n\nOn second thoughts, I am sending a copy of the will so that you may see it for yourself. This is the first will I have ever seen in my life, and I don\'t know what happens. What should I do?\n\nPlease give my kindest hello to Mrs. Greenleaf and realize that I feel deeply for you both, and regret the need to write this letter. Please let me hear from you as soon as possible. My next address will be: c/o American Express, Athens, Greece.\n\nMost sincerely yours, Tom Ripley\n\n\n\n\nIn a way it was asking for trouble, Tom thought. It might make people think again about the signatures, on the will and on the checks. But that was the mood he was in. He had bought his ticket for Greece in the middle of May, and the days had grown finer and finer, making him more and more anxious. He had only two thousand dollars in his own name, moved from Dickie\'s bank and saved out of Dickie\'s income.\n\nThe risk of trying to get all of Dickie\'s money, the danger of it, was exciting to him. He was so bored after the quiet weeks in Venice when each day that went by seemed to remind him of the dullness of his life. Roverini had stopped writing to him. Alvin McCarron had gone back to America, and Tom supposed that he and Mr. Greenleaf had decided that further search was useless.\n\nTom had decided in Venice to make his journey to Greece a heroic one. He would see the islands, swimming for the first time into his view, as a living, breathing, brave individual - not as a frightened little nobody from Boston. If he sailed right into the arms of the police in Greece, at least he would first experience standing in the wind at the front of a ship, crossing the dark sea like an ancient hero.\n\nSo he had written the letter to Mr. Greenleaf and mailed it three days before sailing from Venice. Mr. Greenleaf would probably not get the letter for four or five days, so there would be no time for Mr. Greenleaf to hold him in Venice with a message and make him miss his ship. Besides, it looked better if he was calm about the matter, unable to receive messages for another week or two until he got to Greece. It was better to pretend he didn\'t care whether he got the money or not; he hadn\'t let the fact of the will delay even a little a trip he had planned to make.\n\nTwo days before he sailed, he went to tea at the house of a woman he had met the day he had started looking for a house in Venice. The woman, Titi, greeted him: \"Ah, hello, Thomas! Have you seen the afternoon paper? They have found Dickie\'s suitcases and his paintings! Right here in the American Express in Venice!\" Her gold earrings shook with excitement.\n\n\"What?\" Tom hadn\'t seen the papers. He had been too busy packing that afternoon.\n\n\"Read it! Here! All his clothes, left there only in February! They were sent from Naples. Perhaps he is here in Venice!\"\n\nTom was reading it. The string around the paintings had fallen off, the paper said, and while wrapping them again a worker had discovered the signature of R. Greenleaf on the paintings. Tom\'s hands began to shake, and he had to hold the sides of the paper to calm himself. The paper said that the police were now examining everything carefully for fingerprints.\n\n\"Perhaps he is alive!\" Titi shouted.\n\n\"I don\'t think - I don\'t see why this proves he is alive. Perhaps somebody killed him or he killed himself after he sent the suitcases. The fact that the paintings are under another name - Fanshaw - \"\n\nHe had the feeling that his friend, who was sitting on the sofa staring at him, was surprised by his nervousness, so he calmed himself down quickly and said, \"You see? They\'re looking through everything for clues. They wouldn\'t be doing that if they were sure Dickie had sent the suitcases himself. Why should he leave them in the name of Fanshaw, if he expected to pick them up again himself? His passport\'s even here, it says. He packed his passport.\"\n\n\"Perhaps he is hiding himself under the name of Fanshaw! Oh, my dear, you need some tea! \"\n\n\"It says here that the suitcases contained everything - razor, toothbrush, shoes, overcoat,\" Tom said, hiding his terror in sadness. \"He couldn\'t be alive and leave all that. The murderer probably took everything from his body and left his clothes there because it was the easiest way of getting rid of them.\"\n\n\"Will you not be so sad until you know what the fingerprints are? You are supposed to go on a pleasure trip tomorrow.\"\n\nThe day after tomorrow, Tom thought. Plenty of time for Roverini to get his fingerprints and compare them with the prints on the paintings and in the suitcases.\n\nHe tried to turn his thoughts to Greece. He saw handsome buildings and blue skies. He didn\'t want to go to Greece with the worry about the fingerprints in Venice hanging over him. Tom put his face in his hands and cried. Greece was finished, exploded like a golden ball.\n\nThe worst of all was that Roverini, whose messages had been so friendly until now, sent him no information at all about the discovery of the suitcases. Tom didn\'t sleep that night and then spent a day walking around his house while he tried to finish the endless little duties before leaving for Greece. He expected the police to come knocking at his door at any time of the day or night.\n\n***\n\nBy the time he got onto the ship for Greece, Tom felt like a walking ghost. He was sleepless, foodless, full of coffee, carried along only by his nerves. He remembered last night lying face down on his bed with one arm twisted beneath him, and being too tired to change his position. When he awoke, he felt better except that the arm he had been lying on hung uselessly at his side.\n\nAn angry courage rose in him. What would happen if the radioman was receiving at this minute a message to arrest Tom Ripley? He would stand up just as bravely as he was standing now. Or he might throw himself into the sea. He wasn\'t afraid. This was it. This was the way he had hoped he would feel, sailing to Greece. To look out at the black water all around him and not be afraid was almost as good as seeing the islands of Greece coming into view.\n\nHe considered that he had been lucky beyond reason in escaping arrest for two murders, lucky from the time he had taken Dickie\'s identity until now. The first part of his life had been completely unfair, he thought, but the period with Dickie and afterwards was like a wonderful dream. But something was going to happen now in Greece, he felt, and it couldn\'t be good. His luck had held for too long.\n\nThe only thing he regretted was that he had not seen all the world yet. He wanted to see Australia. And India. He wanted to see Japan. Then there was South America. Just to look at the art of those countries would be a pleasant, rewarding life\'s work, he thought. He had learned a lot about painting, even while trying to copy Dickie\'s bad paintings. At the art museums in Rome, he had discovered an interest in paintings that he had never realized before, or perhaps that had not been in him before.\n\nWhen the boat approached Greece, Tom was standing looking at the land. It wasn\'t a dream ahead of him, it was a solid hill that he could walk on, with buildings that he could touch - if he got that far.\n\nThe police were waiting on the dock. He saw four of them, standing with folded arms, looking up at the ship. Tom turned and walked slowly toward the policemen. He wouldn\'t cause trouble, he thought, he\'d just tell them himself who he was. There was a big newsstand behind the policemen, and he thought of buying a paper. Perhaps they would let him. The policemen stared back at him from over their folded arms as he approached them. They wore black uniforms with caps. Tom smiled at them weakly. One of them touched his cap and stepped to one side. The others didn\'t move closer. Now Tom was almost between two of them, right in front of the newsstand, and the policemen were staring forward again, paying no attention to him at all.\n\nTom bought several newspapers and walked back to the dock to wait for his luggage. Under the R\'s he stopped and opened the oldest Italian paper, which was four days old.\n\nNO ONE NAMED ROBERT S. FANSHAW FOUND IN MYSTERY OF GREENLEAF LUGGAGE.\n\nOnly the fifth paragraph interested him:\n\nThe police discovered a few days ago that the fingerprints on the suitcases and paintings are the same as the fingerprints found in Greenleaf\'s apartment in Rome. Therefore, it is believed that Greenleaf left the suitcases and paintings himself...\n\nTom quickly opened another page:\n\nThere is the possibility that he committed suicide. Another possibility is that he exists at present under the false name of Robert S. Fanshaw or another name. A third possibility is that he was murdered after leaving his bags in Venice.\n\nAnyway, it is useless to search for \"Richard Greenleaf\" any longer, because, even if he is alive, he does not have his \"Richard Greenleaf\" passport...\n\nTom couldn\'t believe his good luck. It meant he wasn\'t suspected at all. It meant that the fingerprints really had guaranteed his innocence. It meant that he was not going to jail, and not going to die, but also that he wasn\'t suspected at all. He was free. Except for Dickie\'s will.\n\nTom boarded the bus for Athens. The will could ruin it all. He looked out the window but he didn\'t notice anything. Maybe the Greek police were waiting for him at the American Express office. Maybe the four men he had seen hadn\'t been police but some kind of soldiers. He got off the bus and jumped in a taxi to go to the American Express.\n\nHe sat up when he saw the American Express sign, and looked around the building for policemen. Maybe the police were inside. Tom looked in. Nothing unusual.\n\nThere was a letter waiting for him from Mr. Greenleaf. He opened it.\n\n\n\n\nJune 9\n\nDear Tom,\n\nReceived your letter yesterday.\n\nIt was not so much of a surprise to my wife and me as you may think. We both realized that Richard was very fond of you, in spite of the fact that he never actually told us this in any of his letters. As you said, the will does suggest that Richard has taken his own life.\n\nMy wife agrees with me that we should follow Richard\'s wishes. So you have, as far as the will is concerned, my personal support. I have given the copy you sent to my lawyers, who will keep you informed about their progress in putting Richard\'s money and other properties in your name.\n\nOnce more, thank you for your assistance when I was overseas. Let us hear from you.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nHerbert Greenleaf\n\n\n\n\nWas it a joke? But the paper in his hand felt real. Besides, Mr. Greenleaf wouldn\'t joke like this, not in a million years. Tom walked to the waiting taxi. It was no joke. It was his! Dickie\'s money and his freedom. He could have a house in Europe, and a house in America too, if he chose.\n\nHe grew suddenly worried, and his dreams disappeared. Was he going to see policemen waiting for him on every dock that he ever approached? In Alexandria? In Istanbul? Bombay? Rio? No use thinking about that. No use ruining his trip thinking about imaginary policemen.\n\n\"Where to? Where to?\" the taxi driver was asking.\n\n\"To a hotel, please,\" Tom said with a laugh. \"The best hotel. The best, the best!\"\n\n- THE END -', 1, 1, 0, '', 30884, 11701),
(30887, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo\n\nPart 1\n\nJean Valjean\n\nOne evening in October 1815, an hour before sunset, a man with a long beard and dusty, torn clothes walked into the town of Digne. He was in his late forties, of medium height, broad-shouldered and strong. A leather cap half-hid his face, which was sunburnt and shining with sweat. His rough yellow shirt was unbuttoned, revealing a hairy chest. On his back was a heavy soldier\'s bag, and in his hand was a large wooden stick.\n\nThe townspeople, who had never seen him before, watched with interest as he stopped for water at a fountain. Children followed him to the marketplace, where he stopped for more water at another fountain. He then crossed the square towards an inn, and entered by the kitchen door.\n\nThe innkeeper, who was also the cook, was busy with his pots and pans, preparing a meal for a group of travellers who were laughing and joking in the next room.\n\n\'What can I do for you, Monsieur?\' he asked without looking up.\n\n\'A meal and a bed,\' said the stranger.\n\n\'Of course.\' The innkeeper turned to look at him. Then, seeing the visitors rough appearance, he added, \'If you can pay for it.\'\n\n\'I have money.\' The stranger produced an old leather purse from his jacket.\n\n\'Then you\'re welcome,\' the innkeeper said.\n\nThe stranger smiled with relief and sat down by the fire. He did not see a young boy run out with a note that the innkeeper had quickly written. He did not see the boy return a short time later and whisper something to the innkeeper.\n\n\'When will the meal be ready?\' the stranger asked.\n\n\'I\'m sorry, Monsieur,\' the innkeeper said. \'You can\'t stay here. I\'ve got no free rooms.\'\n\n\'Then put me in a stable. All I need is a quiet corner somewhere. After dinner\n\n\'You can\'t eat here either,\' the innkeeper interrupted. \'I haven\'t enough food.\'\n\n\'What about all that food in the pots?\'\n\nThe innkeeper approached and, bending towards the man, said in a fierce whisper, \'Get out. I know who you are. Your name is Jean Valjean. You\'ve just been released from prison. I can\'t serve people like you here.\'\n\nThe man rose without another word, picked up his bag and stick, and left. Outside, it was growing dark and a cold wind was blowing from the mountains in the east. The man looked around, desperate for somewhere to spend the night. He tried another inn, but the same thing happened. He knocked on the doors of people\'s houses, but news of his arrival had quickly spread and nobody would offer him shelter from the cold. He even tried sleeping in a garden, but was chased away by a dog. Finally, he found himself in the cathedral square. He shook his fist at the church and then, cold and hungry, he lay down on a stone bench by the doorway.\n\nA few minutes later, an old woman came out of the cathedral and saw him lying there.\n\n\'What are you doing?\' she asked.\n\nHe answered angrily, \'Can\'t you see? I\'m trying to sleep.\'\n\n\'On this bench, in this cold wind?\'\n\n\'I\'ve slept for nineteen years on a piece of wood. Now it\'s stone. What\'s the difference?\'\n\n\'Why don\'t you go to an inn?\'\n\n\'Because I haven\'t any money,\' he lied.\n\nThe old woman opened her purse and gave him a few coins. Then she said, \'Have you tried everywhere?\'\n\n\'I\'ve knocked at every door.\'\n\n\'What about that one over there?\' she said, pointing across the square to a small house beside the bishop\'s palace.\n\n***\n\nThe Bishop of Digne was a kind old man who, many years earlier, had given his palace to the town hospital. He lived a simple life with his sister, Mademoiselle Baptistine, and his old servant, Madame Magloire, and he was much loved by the people in the town. He trusted everyone. His doors were never locked, so that anybody who needed his help could find him easily.\n\nThat evening, Mme Magloire was chatting with Mile Baptistine before serving the meal.\n\n\'People say there\'s a stranger in town,\' she said. \'The police say that he looks dangerous, and it would be better for everyone to lock their windows and doors.\'\n\n\'Brother.\' Mile Baptistine turned to the bishop, who was sitting by the fire. \'Did you hear what Mme Magloire was saying?\'\n\n\'Something about a dangerous stranger walking the streets?\' he asked with an amused smile.\n\n\'This is no joke,\' Mme Magloire said. \'The man is in rags and has an evil look on his face. Everybody in the town agrees that something terrible will happen tonight. And your sister agrees with me that this house isn\'t safe. If you like, I can make arrangements now to get a lock put on the door\n\nBefore the bishop could reply, there was a heavy knock on the door.\n\n\'Come in,\' said the bishop.\n\nThe door opened and Jean Valjean, the stranger, walked in. Mme Magloire trembled, open-mouthed with fear, while Mile Baptistine rose from her seat with alarm. The bishop, however, looked calmly at his unexpected visitor.\n\n\'My name is Jean Valjean,\' the stranger said before anybody could speak. \'I\'ve been in prison for nineteen years. They let me out four days ago. I\'ve been walking all day, and nobody in this town will give me food or a bed for the night. A woman saw me lying on a stone bench across the square and suggested that I come here. So here I am. What is this place? Is it an inn? I\'ve got money. Will you let me stay?\'\n\n\'Mme Magloire,\' said the bishop, \'will you please prepare another place at the table for this gentleman?\'\n\nValjean took a step forward. \'No, you don\'t understand,\' he said. \'I\'ve spent five years in prison for violent robbery, another fourteen years for trying to escape four times. I\'m a dangerous man.\'\n\n\'Mme Magloire,\' the bishop went on, \'you must put clean sheets on the bed in the spare room.\'\n\nMme Magloire, an obedient servant, left the room without protest.\n\nThe bishop turned to the man. \'Sit down and warm yourself, Monsieur. Supper will soon be ready.\'\n\nJean Valjean\'s face, which had been hard and fierce, suddenly softened. \'You really mean it?\' he asked, his voice trembling with childish excitement. \'You\'ll let me stay? I\'m a dangerous criminal, but you called me \"Monsieur\". I don\'t believe it. May I ask your name, sir? Are you an innkeeper?\'\n\n\'I\'m a priest,\' said the bishop. \'And this is where I live.\'\n\n\'A priest?\' Valjean said, sitting by the fire. \'So I don\'t have to pay?\'\n\n\'You can keep your money,\' the bishop replied.\n\nDuring dinner, Mile Baptistine looked at Valjean kindly while the bishop talked about the local cheese-making industry. Valjean was so hungry that, at first, he paid no attention to anyone. Soon, however, he began to relax, and looked around the room. \'This is not the house of a rich man,\' he thought. \'And the travellers in the inn eat better than this.\' But then he looked at the table, and saw the beautiful silver candlesticks, knives and forks.\n\nAfter dinner, the bishop said goodnight to his sister, picked up one of the two candlesticks and, handing the other to his guest, said, \'I\'ll show you to your room, Monsieur.\'\n\nValjean followed the bishop upstairs into a bedroom. This was the bishop\'s bedroom. As he was following the bishop across the room, however, he noticed Mme Magloire putting the silver knives and forks in a cupboard by the bed.\n\nThe bishop showed his guest into the spare room.\n\n\'Sleep well,\' he said. \'Before you leave tomorrow, you must have a bowl of warm milk from our cows.\'\n\nValjean was so tired that he fell asleep, fully-dressed, on top of the sheets, but he didn\'t sleep for long. When he woke up, the cathedral clock was striking two, but he had not woken because of this. He had woken because the bed was too comfortable; he had not slept in a proper bed for twenty years. Unable to return to sleep, he gazed into the darkness, thinking about the past twenty years. Life had been unjust to him, and he was angry. In 1795, he had lost his job as a tree-cutter. At that time he was looking after his sister, whose husband had died, and her seven children. Out of work, and with no food in the house, he had been arrested for trying to steal a loaf of bread. Now, at last, he was free, but he felt bitter and angry about his lost years. The world had been unfair to him, and he wanted revenge. Then, remembering the silver on the bishop\'s table, he had an idea.\n\nHe sat up, swung his feet to the floor and slowly stood up. The house was silent. He moved carefully towards the window and looked out. The night was not very dark; there was a full moon, hidden from time to time by large clouds moving quickly across the sky. After studying the garden, he decided that escape would be easy. He turned back to the room, picked up his bag and took out a short iron bar, sharpened at one end. He then put his shoes into the bag and, grasping the iron bar in his right hand, he moved quietly towards the door of the bishop\'s bedroom. It was half-open. The bishop had not closed it.\n\nValjean stood listening. There was no sound.\n\nHe gave the door a gentle push and crept into the bedroom. Just as he reached the side of the bishop\'s bed, the moon came out from behind a cloud and filled the room with light. Valjean gazed down at the bishop\'s gentle, sleeping face, and felt a kind of terror. He had never before seen such peace, such kindness, such trust.\n\nHe suddenly turned away and moved quickly to the cupboard. The first thing he saw when he opened the door was the basket of silver. He grabbed it, hurried back to the spare bedroom, picked up his stick and bag, climbed out of the window, emptied the silver into his bag and threw the basket into the garden. A minute later he climbed the garden wall and disappeared into the trees.\n\nEarly the next morning, while the bishop was studying the flowers in his garden, Mme Magloire ran out of the house with a look of alarm on her face.\n\n\'Monseigneur, do you know where the silver-basket is?\'\n\n\'Yes,\' said the bishop. \'I found it in one of the flowerbeds.\'\n\n\'But it\'s empty!\' she cried. \'Where\'s the silver?\'\n\n\'Oh, you\'re worried about the silver? I don\'t know where that is.\'\n\n\'Heaven save us, it\'s been stolen!\' she cried. \'The man who came last night! He\'s run off with our silver!\'\n\nThe bishop, who had been bending sadly over a plant damaged by the basket, looked up and said gently, \'I think I was wrong to keep the silver for so long. It really belongs to the poor. I should have given it away a long time ago.\'\n\nLater that morning, as the bishop and his sister were having breakfast, there was a knock on the door. Four men walked into the room. Three of them were policemen; the fourth was Jean Valjean.\n\n\'Monseigneur... \' the sergeant in charge of the group began.\n\nValjean raised his head with surprise. \'Monseigneur?\' he repeated. \'I thought he was a priest.\'\n\n\'Silence,\' said one of the policemen, \'This is the Bishop of Digne.\'\n\nThe bishop, meanwhile, had moved towards the group of men and was smiling at Jean Valjean.\n\n\'I\'m delighted to see you again, dear friend,\' he said. \'But what about the candlesticks? I gave you those as well, don\'t you remember? They\'re silver like the rest, and worth at least two hundred francs. Did you forget to take them?\'\n\nJean Valjean\'s eyes widened with disbelief.\n\n\'Monseigneur,\' said the sergeant, \'do I understand that this man was telling the truth? We found this silver in his bag, and\n\n\'And he told you,\' the bishop finished the sentence for him, \'that an old priest had given it to him? Yes, he was telling the truth.\'\n\n\'So this man isn\'t a thief? \'The sergeant looked as surprised as Valjean.\n\n\'Not at all. So you can let him go at once.\'\n\nThe policemen let go of Valjean\'s arms. He moved his feet nervously, uncertain of what to say at first. Then he murmured, \'Am I really free to go?\'\n\n\'Of course,\' said the bishop. \'But this time, you mustn\'t forget your candlesticks.\'\n\nHe fetched them from a shelf and gave them to Valjean.\n\n\'Now, go in peace,\' he said softly.\n\nThe policemen left, but Valjean did not move. He did not know what to think. The bishop walked up to him and said in a low voice, \'Don\'t forget that you\'ve promised to use the money to make yourself an honest man.\'\n\nValjean, who did not remember having made such a promise, was silent.\n\n\'Jean Valjean,\' the bishop continued, \'I\'ve bought your soul from the Devil, and have given it to God.\'\n\n***\n\nJean Valjean left the town and ran into the countryside, blindly following lanes and paths, not realizing that he was running in circles. He was filled with a strange kind of anger, but he did not know why. Finally, as evening fell, he sat on the ground, exhausted, and gazed across the fields at the distant mountains, wishing that he was back in prison. When he had been angry at the world, he had felt calm and sure of himself. But now, for the first time in twenty years, a man had shown him great kindness, and he did not know what to feel.\n\nSuddenly, he heard the sound of singing. A boy of about ten years old was coming along a footpath with a small box on his back and dirty knees showing through holes in his trousers. As he sang, he threw a coin into the air and caught it before it fell. Not noticing Jean Valjean sitting by the side of the path, he threw the coin higher into the air. This time, however, he did not catch it and it rolled along the ground towards Valjean, who immediately put his foot on it.\n\nThe boy, unafraid, walked up to Valjean.\n\n\'Please, Monsieur, may I have my coin?\'\n\n\'What\'s your name?\' asked Valjean.\n\n\'Petit-Gervais,\' said the boy, smiling trustfully. \'I\'m a chimney sweep, and that money is all I have.\'\n\n\'Go away,\' said Valjean.\n\n\'Please, Monsieur, that\'s my money.\'\n\nValjean lowered his head and did not reply.\n\n\'My money!\' the boy cried. \'My piece of silver! My coin!\'\n\nValjean seemed not to hear him. The boy seized his collar and shook him. \'I want my money!\' he cried.\n\nValjean slowly raised his head and stared with a sort of amazement at the child. Then, reaching for his stick, he said, \'Go to Hell!\'\n\nThe boy, suddenly afraid of the mad, fierce look in Valjean\'s eyes, turned and ran.\n\nValjean stood for some time gazing emptily around him at the sunset and the shadows moving in on him. Suddenly he shivered, as if he had become aware for the first time of the icy wind. He bent down to pick up his bag but, as he did so, he caught sight of the silver coin, half-buried by his foot in the earth.\n\nIt affected him like an electric shock. \'What\'s that?\' he murmured. He stared at the coin with a look of puzzlement, as if he were trying to remember something. Then, with a sudden movement, he bent down and picked it up. He looked around but could see nothing in the darkness - just a purple mist rising slowly from the fields.\n\nHe called the boy\'s name, but there was no reply. Within minutes he was running along the path, shouting. \'Petit-Gervais! Petit-Gervais!\' There was still no reply.\n\nA short time later, he met a priest on horseback.\n\n\'Have you seen a boy go by?\' he asked.\n\nThe priest shook his head. \'No. Why do you ask?\'\n\nValjean produced two five-franc pieces and gave them to the priest. \'This is for your poor, Monsieur. He was a boy of about ten, a chimney sweep. Monsieur, you must report me to the police. I\'m a thief. I stole money from him. Here, let me give you more money\n\nBut before Valjean could produce more coins, the priest rode away in terror.\n\nValjean looked for the boy for another hour, running along the path, calling out his name, but with no success. Finally he stopped and sat, exhausted, on a rock. Then, his heart full of grief for what he had done, he buried his face in his hands and, for the first time in nineteen years, he cried.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30886, 11701);

(30889, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo\n\nPart 2\n\nFantine\n\nOn a spring evening in 1818, in the village of Montfermeil, not far from Paris, two little girls were playing on a swing outside a small inn. Their mother - a big, red-haired woman with a plain face - sat on the doorstep of the inn, watching them.\n\n\'You have two very pretty children, Madame,\' a voice said from close beside her.\n\nThe woman looked round and saw a young woman with a child sleeping peacefully in her arms. The mother was young and pretty, but she looked poor and unhappy. She did not smile, and lines of sadness ran down the side of her pale cheeks. Her clothes were old and dirty, and she wore a tight, plain cap over her beautiful blonde hair.\n\n\'Thank you,\' said the woman. \'Why don\'t you sit down for a minute? You look tired. \'When the young woman had sat down next to her, the red-haired woman introduced herself. \'My name\'s Thenardier. My husband and I manage this inn.\'\n\n\'My names Fantine,\' the young woman said. \'I used to work in Paris, but my husband died and I lost my job.\' She could not tell Mme Thenardier the truth, which was that she had been made pregnant by a young man who had then abandoned her. \'I left Paris this morning to look for work in Montreuil,\' she continued. \'My little girl walked some of the way, but she\'s very small. I had to carry her and she\'s fallen asleep.\' As she spoke these words, she gave her daughter a loving kiss, which woke her up. The child\'s eyes were as wide and blue as her mother\'s. With a little laugh, she jumped off her mother\'s lap and ran to play with the two girls on the swing.\n\n\'What\'s your little girl\'s name?\' Mme Thenardier asked.\n\n\'Euphrasie - but I call her Cosette. She\'s nearly three.\'\n\nThe two women watched the children playing together.\n\n\'Children make friends very easily, don\'t they?\' Mme Thenardier smiled. \'Look at them. They could easily be sisters.\'\n\nAt these words, Fantine did a very strange thing. She took Mme Thenardiers hand and said, \'Will you look after my daughter for me?\'\n\nMme Thenardier looked at Fantine thoughtfully, but said nothing.\n\n\'I can\'t take her with me,\' Fantine continued. \'I have to find work, and that\'s not easy with a child but no husband. As soon as I find a job, I\'ll come and fetch her. Will you do that for me? I could pay six francs a month.\'\n\nMme Thenardier still said nothing, but a man\'s voice from inside the house called, \'We\'ll take seven francs a month, and six months in advance.\'\n\nFantine agreed.\n\n\'And another fifteen francs for extras,\' called the man.\n\n\'You will have them,\' said Fantine, assuming that she was talking to Mme Thenardiers husband. \'I have eighty francs.\'\n\n\'Does the child have enough clothes?\' the man asked.\n\n\'She has some beautiful clothes,\' Fantine replied. \'Plenty of everything and silk dresses like a lady. They\'re all in my bag.\'\n\nThe man\'s face finally appeared in the doorway.\n\n\'Then we agree to look after her for you,\' he said.\n\nThe next morning, Fantine kissed her daughter goodbye and left for Montreuil, crying as if her heart would break.\n\n\'This money will be useful,\'Thenardier said to his wife. \'Now I can pay off all my debts and stay out of prison. I\'m proud of you. You set a very clever trap.\'\n\n\'Without even intending to,\' his wife replied.\n\nOne month later, Thenardier was short of money again, so he took Cosette\'s beautiful silk clothes to Paris and sold them for sixty francs. The couple dressed Cosette in rags and gave her very little food, which they made her eat from a wooden bowl under the table. The dog and the cat, who ate with her, were her only companions.\n\nFantine, meanwhile, found work in Montreuil and asked for news of her daughter every month. The Thenardiers always replied that she was in good health and very happy. At the end of the year, however, Thenardier was not happy with just seven francs a month; he demanded twelve and Fantine paid without protest, happy that her daughter was being well cared for.\n\nThe Thenardiers, who were loving and gentle to their own daughters, Eponine and Azelma, treated Cosette like a slave.\n\nThey made her get up before dawn every day and do all the dirty jobs around the house, while Eponine and Azelma wore pretty clothes and played with dolls. By the age of five, Cosette had become a thin, pale-faced, silent child. Misery had made her ugly and only her beautiful blue eyes remained.\n\nThe Thenardiers did not feel guilty about treating Cosette badly because Fantine had stopped sending them regular payments.\n\n\'The child is lucky to have a home at all,\' they told everybody.\n\n\'Without us, she\'d be living on the streets.\'\n\n***\n\nWhen Fantine first arrived in Montreuil, she had immediately found work in a factory. She rented a small room, sent money regularly to the Thenardiers and, for a short time, was almost happy. She forgot many of her problems, and dreamt only of Cosette and her plans for the future. But her happiness did not last long. Although she was careful to say nothing about her daughter to anyone, other women at the factory soon discovered her secret. An unmarried woman with a child was a terrible thing in those days, and Fantine lost her job. She tried to find work as a servant, but no one would employ her. She finally managed to earn a little money sewing shirts, but she was unable to send money regularly to the Thenardiers.\n\nThat winter, Fantine saved money by not having a fire, and developed a small, dry cough. By the following winter, her debts had increased. The Thenardiers wrote her a frightening letter in which they told her that Cosette had no clothes, and that they needed ten francs immediately to buy her a new dress. Fantine, who did not have ten francs, but who was afraid that her daughter would freeze to death, went to the barber\'s shop. She took out her comb and let her blonde hair fall down to her waist.\n\n\'Such beautiful hair!\' the barber said.\n\n\'How much will you give me for it?\' Fantine asked.\n\n\'Ten francs.\'\n\n\'Then cut it off.\'\n\nAfter selling her hair to the barber, Fantine was able to buy a woollen dress, which she sent to the Thenardiers. The Thenardiers, however, were very angry - they had wanted money, not clothes. They gave the dress to their daughter, Eponine, and Cosette went on shivering.\n\nA few weeks later, Fantine received another letter from the Thenardiers. This time they wanted forty francs because Cosette was very ill and urgently needed medicine. Fantine felt desperate; she did not know how to obtain such a large sum of money. As she was wandering around the town, desperately trying to decide what to do, she noticed a crowd of people in the market square. She approached them without thinking, and discovered that they had gathered around a travelling dentist. Forgetting her troubles for a moment, she smiled at the dentist\'s humorous efforts to sell the people of Montreuil false teeth.\n\nSuddenly the dentist saw her.\n\n\'You\'ve got lovely teeth,\' he said. \'If you sold me your two front teeth, I\'d pay you forty francs.\'\n\nFantine ran home, upset and disgusted. \'My hair will grow again,\' she thought, \'but teeth would be gone forever.\' But then she thought about her daughter, and her own appearance suddenly seemed unimportant. That evening, she visited the dentist at the inn where he was staying, and allowed him to remove her teeth.\n\nFantine could not sleep that night. She sat on her bed, cold and shivering, and looked at the two coins shining on the table. Then she gave a blood-stained smile. \'I\'m happy,\' she told herself. \'My baby isn\'t going to die.\'\n\nFantine earned less and less money from her sewing, and the Thenardiers demanded more and more money to look after Cosette. Fantine spent whole nights crying. What could she do? She had sold her hair and her teeth; what else could she sell? And then she decided that she had no other choice: she would have to sell herself.\n\nShe became a prostitute.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30888, 11701),
(30891, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo\n\nPart 3\n\nMonsieur Madeleine\n\nOne winter\'s evening, a toothless woman with a grey face and flowers in her hair was arrested for attacking a man in the street. She was taken to the police station, where Inspector Javert, the chief of police, sent her to prison for six months.\n\n\'Please, M. Javert.\' The woman fell to her knees. \'I owe a hundred francs. If I don\'t pay, my little girl will lose her home and be thrown out on to the streets. Please don\'t send me to prison.\'\n\nJavert listened to her coldly, then ordered a policeman to take her away. While the policeman was trying to drag her to her feet, however, a voice from the shadows said, \'One moment please.\'\n\nJavert looked up and saw Monsieur Madeleine, one of the most important people in the town.\n\nM. Madeleine had arrived mysteriously in Montreuil one December evening in 1815. He had no money but he had a revolutionary idea: he knew a cheap and efficient method of manufacturing glass. Within a few months of his arrival, thanks to his new idea, the glass-making factory in Montreuil was making enormous profits. With the money he made, M. Madeleine built two new factories, which provided the town with hundreds of new jobs. He became a very wealthy man but lived a simple life, using most of his money to build new hospitals and schools. He was so popular that, in 1820, the townspeople elected him mayor of Montreuil.\n\nThere was one man, however, who did not like M. Madeleine. This was the chief of police, Inspector Javert.\n\nHe had always been suspicious of M. Madeleine, and was sure that he had seen him somewhere before, many years earlier. But he kept his suspicions to himself, not daring to say what he really believed: that M. Madeleine was, in fact, a dangerous criminal with a terrible past.\n\nNow, years later, M. Madeleine was in the police station, trying to save Fantine from prison. Fantine, however, was not grateful. In fact, when she saw who it was, she spat at him.\n\n\'You own the factory where I used to work!\' she shouted at him. \'I lost my job because of you. Now I\'ve become a bad woman, but what choice did I have? I\'ll never get my daughter back if I don\'t make money.\'\n\nThe mayor turned to Inspector Javert and said, in a soft, firm voice, \'This woman must be released.\'\n\n\'That\'s impossible,\' Javert replied. \'She attacked a man in the street, a respectable citizen. And now I\'ve just seen her spit at you, the mayor of our town. A woman like this deserves to be punished.\'\n\n\'But I saw what happened in the street just now,\' M. Madeleine said. \'It was the man\'s fault, not this woman\'s. You should arrest him, not her.\'\n\nJavert argued with M. Madeleine for some time, but finally gave in. He walked angrily out of the room, leaving the mayor and the prostitute alone together. Fantine trembled, as confused as Javert had been. The man who had just saved her from prison was also the man who had caused all her troubles. The devil had suddenly decided to be kind, and she did not know what to think.\n\n\'I heard what you said,\' M. Madeleine said to her. \'I honestly didn\'t know that you had lost your job, but I\'ll try to help you now. I\'ll pay your debts and arrange for your child to return to you. I\'ll give you all the money you need. I\'ll make you happy again. And I promise that, in the eyes of God, you have never been a bad woman.\'\n\nFantine gazed at M. Madeleine with tears in her eyes. After all her pain and suffering she had, for the first time in her life, found kindness in another human being. At last she would be cared for, and she could look forward to a life of happiness with Cosette. Without a word, she fell to her knees and kissed the back of M. Madeleine\'s hand.\n\nM. Madeleine sent the Thenardiers 300 francs and told them to send Cosette to Montreuil immediately. Thenardier, thinking that Fantine had suddenly become rich, wrote back and demanded 500 francs. M. Madeleine sent the money, but the Thenardiers found even more dishonest excuses for not sending Cosette back.\n\n***\n\nThe weeks passed and, although she was happier than she had been for a long time, Fantine caught a fever. Months of poverty and misery had made her ill, and she soon became so weak that she was unable to leave her bed.\n\n\'When shall I see Cosette?\' she kept asking M. Madeleine when he visited her.\n\n\'Very soon,\' he would reply, and her pale face would light up with joy.\n\nOne morning, as M. Madeleine was making preparations to leave for Montfermeil and to fetch Cosette himself, he had a visitor. Inspector Javert walked into his office, and stood in silence waiting for him to look up from his work.\n\n\'Well, Javert, what is it?\' M. Madeleine finally said.\n\n\'I\'ve come to apologize, M. Madeleine,\' the inspector replied.\n\n\'What are you talking about?\'\n\n\'I\'ve treated you unjustly. I was angry with you six weeks ago when you told me to release that woman. I wrote to the police headquarters in Paris and told them about you.\'\n\n\'Told them what about me?\'\n\n\'Forgive me, M. Madeleine, but I believed you were a man called Jean Valjean. He was a prisoner I saw twenty years ago, when I worked at a prison in Toulon. After being released from prison, this Valjean stole some silver from the Bishop of Digne and robbed a small boy on a public footpath. We tried to catch him, but he disappeared. When you arrived in Montreuil, I felt sure that you were this man, but now I know I was wrong, and I\'m sorry. You will, of course, dismiss me from my job, as I\'ve shown that I don\'t deserve your trust.\'\n\nM. Madeleine, looking hard at Javert without expression, said quietly, \'I\'m afraid I don\'t understand.\'\n\n\'The police headquarters in Paris told me that Jean Valjean was arrested last autumn for stealing apples,\' Javert explained. He\'d changed his name to Champmathieu and had lived for several years in the village of Ailly-le-Haut-Cloche. Two ex-prisoners from Toulon recognized him as Jean Valjean. I visited the man in Arras prison, and I saw for myself that he is indeed Jean Valjean. Of course, he denies everything, but that\'s not surprising. If he\'s found guilty of stealing from the bishop - who, as you know, died a couple of years ago - and of robbing the small boy, he\'ll spend the rest of his life in prison.\'\n\nM. Madeleine looked down at his papers.\n\n\'This matter is of no interest to me, Javert,\' he said casually. \'I\'m sure you have other work to do.\'\n\n\'I was going to the man\'s trial in Arras tomorrow, \'Javert said. \'But after this conversation, you must dismiss me.\'\n\nM. Madeleine rose to his feet.\n\n\'Javert,\' he said, \'you\'re an honourable man. You made one small mistake, that\'s all. I want you to continue your excellent work as inspector of police.\'\n\nHe offered Javert his hand, but the inspector refused to take it. Instead, he said, \'I\'ve behaved unjustly towards an innocent man. I cannot shake his hand.\'\n\nWith those words he bowed and left the office, leaving M. Madeleine to stare at the papers on his desk with an empty, puzzled look in his eyes.\n\nThat afternoon, M. Madeleine visited Fantine. She had a high fever, and was coughing badly, but she still had only one thing on her mind.\n\n\'Cosette?\' she asked him.\n\n\'Very soon,\' he assured her.\n\nHe sat by her bed for an hour and then, having told the nurses to look after her, he returned to his home. He stayed awake all night, thinking of Javert\'s story about Champmathieu. The reader has probably already realized that M. Madeleine was really Jean Valjean, and M. Madeleine - as we shall continue to call him for this part of the story - knew that he could not let Champmathieu go to prison for crimes he had not committed. He knew - although he was not happy to admit this - that he would have to go to Arras and tell the truth. He would lose everything that he had worked so hard to achieve. He would also have to break his promise to Fantine about bringing Cosette from Montfermeil. But what choice did he have? The truth was more important than anything else.\n\n***\n\nThe next morning, M. Madeleine set off on the long journey to Arras. It took him more than twelve hours, and when he arrived, he discovered that Champmathieu\'s trial had already started. The courtroom was full but, because he was such an important man, M. Madeleine was allowed to sit behind the judge\'s chair. He watched as several witnesses swore on the Bible that the man standing before the judge was Jean Valjean. Champmathieu, a large, simple-minded man, denied everything when his chance came to speak, but the crowd thought he was trying to be funny. The courtroom filled with laughter and Champmathieu began to laugh himself, which did him no good at all.\n\nFinally, having heard all the evidence, the judge called for silence. He was preparing to announce his decision when M. Madeleine, pale and trembling, stood up and said:\n\n\'That man is not Jean Valjean.\'\n\nAn excited whisper went around the courtroom as everybody recognized M. Madeleine.\n\nM. Madeleine waited for the whispers to stop before announcing in a loud, clear voice that he was Jean Valjean. At first, no one believed him, but he managed to persuade the court by skilfully questioning each of the witnesses, revealing personal information that only the real Jean Valjean could have known. When he had persuaded the court of the truth of his confession, he was faced with a shocked but respectful silence.\n\n\'I must leave now,\' M. Madeleine finally said. \'I have important business to attend to. You know where to find me, and I shall not try to escape.\'\n\nEverybody stood to one side to let him pass as he made his way towards the door. When he had gone, the judge immediately allowed Champmathieu to leave the court a free man. Champmathieu went home in a state of total confusion, thinking all men mad and understanding nothing of what had happened.\n\n***\n\nAt dawn the next day, M. Madeleine entered Fantine\'s room.\n\n\'How is she?\' he asked the nurse, who was watching her as she slept.\n\n\'She seems better. She\'s looking forward to seeing her child.\'\n\n\'I haven\'t brought the child with me,\' M. Madeleine said.\n\n\'Then what can we say to her when she wakes up?\' The nurse looked suddenly worried. \'It will destroy her if she doesn\'t see her child now, after you promised to bring her.\'\n\n\'God will guide me,\' M. Madeleine sighed.\n\nFor some time M. Madeleine sat by the bedside and watched Fantine while she slept. She was breathing with great difficulty, but her face looked peaceful and calm. Suddenly, she opened her eyes and saw M. Madeleine.\n\n\'Cosette?\' she asked, with a soft smile.\n\n\'Later,\' M. Madeleine said gently, taking her hand. \'You\'re too weak to see her at the moment. First you must get well.\'\n\nFantine smiled, and began to talk dreamily about her future life with her daughter, and how happy they would be together. But suddenly her face froze, and she stared with horror at the door. M. Madeleine, who was holding her hand, turned and saw Inspector Javert. Fantine, thinking that the inspector had come for her, gripped M. Madeleine\'s hand tightly and begged him to protect her.\n\n\'Don\'t be afraid.\' M. Madeleine tried to calm her. \'He hasn\'t come for you.\' Then, gently rising from his chair, he moved towards Javert. \'I know what you\'ve come for,\' he said quietly so that Fantine wouldn\'t hear. \'But give me three days, please. That\'s all I ask. Three days to fetch this unfortunate woman\'s child. I\'ll pay anything you like.\'\n\n\'Do you think I\'m stupid?\' Javert gave an unpleasant laugh. \'Three days to escape, you mean.\'\n\nFantine, who had heard what M. Madeleine said, despite his efforts to speak quietly, began to tremble.\n\n\'To fetch my child?\' she cried. \'Isn\'t she here? Nurse, answer me... where\'s my little Cosette? I want to see her. M. Madeleine\n\n\'Be quiet, you dirty prostitute,\' Javert interrupted her angrily. \'There is no Monsieur Madeleine. This man\'s name is Jean Valjean, and he\'s a criminal no better than you are. And you can forget all that nonsense about your child.\n\nFantine suddenly sat up. She stared wildly at the two men, then turned to the nurse. She looked as if she was going to speak, but no words came from her lips. Instead, with a small sigh, she fell back against her pillow and lay completely still.\n\nJean Valjean (as we must now call him) shook Javert\'s hand from his collar and ran to the bed. He gazed into Fantine\'s eyes and knew immediately that she was dead.\n\n\'You\'ve killed her!\' he cried angrily, turning to Javert with a fierce look in his eyes.\n\n\'I didn\'t come here to argue,\' Javert said, stepping back nervously, afraid that Valjean was going to attack him. \'If you don\'t come with me now, I\'ll have to call my men.\'\n\nValjean looked around the room, thinking for a second of making his escape. But the idea did not last for long. He turned again to Fantine and looked for one last time at her sad, pale face and empty, blue eyes. Bending down, he closed her eyes and pressed his lips against her forehead. Then he rose and turned back to Javert.\n\n\'I\'m ready now,\' he said.\n\nNews of M. Madeleine\'s arrest spread quickly around the town. Most people pretended not to be surprised. \'We always knew there was something strange about him,\' they said. Two days after his arrest, Jean Valjean escaped from prison. The bars of his window had been broken during the night. Again, most people pretended not to be surprised. \'It takes more than a small town prison to hold a man as strong as that,\' they all agreed.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30890, 11701),
(30893, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo\n\nPart 4\n\nThe Man in the Long Yellow Coat\n\nChristmas 1823 was especially lively and colourful in the village of Montfermeil. Entertainers and traders from Paris set up their stalls in the streets, and business at the Thenardiers\' inn was very good. While guests and visitors ate and drank noisily, Cosette - now eight years old - sat in her usual place under the kitchen table. Dressed in rags, she knitted woollen stockings for Eponine and Azelma.\n\nOne evening, Madame Thenardier ordered Cosette out into the cold to fetch water. The nearest water supply was half-way down the wooded hill on which Montfermeil stood, and Cosette hated fetching water, especially in the dark. Miserably, she picked up a large, empty bucket that was almost as big as she was, and was walking with it to the door when Madame Thenardier stopped her.\n\n\'Buy some bread on the way,\' she said, giving the girl some money.\n\nCosette took the coin, put it carefully in her pocket and left. She was cold and hungry as she dragged the bucket behind her along the crowded street, but she could not resist stopping in front of one of the stalls. It was like a palace to her, with its bright lights, shining glass and pretty objects. But the object that most attracted Cosette\'s attention was a large, golden-haired doll in a beautiful long pink dress. All the children in Montfermeil had gazed with wonder at this doll, but nobody in the village had enough money to buy it.\n\nCosette gazed at the doll for several minutes but, remembering her job, she sighed and continued on her way. She had soon left the colourful lights and the happy laughter of the village behind her, and was running down the hill into the frightening darkness of the wood. Finding the stream, she bent forward and began to fill her bucket. She did not notice the coin that Mme Thenardier had given her for the bread fall out of her pocket into the water. When the bucket was full, she gripped the handle with her tiny, frozen hands and tried to pull it back up the hill. But the bucket was so heavy that, after a dozen steps, she had to stop for a rest. She managed a few more steps, and stopped again. Her progress became slower and slower. She was almost at the end of her strength, and she was still not out of the wood. Leaning against a tree, she cried aloud:\n\n\'Oh God help me! Please, dear God!\'\n\nSuddenly, an enormous hand reached down from the sky and took the bucket of water from her. Looking up, Cosette saw a huge, white-haired man standing next to her. He looked very strange with his tall black hat and long yellow coat.\n\n\'This is a very heavy bucket for such a small child,\' he said gently, looking down at her from his great height.\n\nFor some reason, Cosette was not afraid. There was something about his eyes, tilled with a strange sadness, that she liked and trusted. She let him carry the bucket up the hill and, as they walked back towards the village, she told him everything about her life with the Thenardiers. The old man listened with great interest, and asked her many questions.\n\nAs they were approaching the inn, Cosette turned to him and said, \'May I have the bucket now? If Mme Thenardier sees that someone has been helping me, she\'ll beat me.\'\n\nThe old man gave her the bucket, and they entered the inn together.\n\n\'What took you so long?\' Mme Thenardier said angrily when she saw the little girl.\n\n\'This gentleman wants a room for the night,\' Cosette said, trembling with fear, expecting to be beaten.\n\nMme Thenardier glanced at the old man without interest. She could tell from his clothes that he probably had no money.\n\n\'I\'m sorry, the rooms are full,\' she said.\n\n\'I can pay the price of a room,\' the old man said.\n\n\'Forty sous,\' Mme Thenardier replied (although the usual price was twenty).\n\n\'Forty sous,\' the man agreed.\n\nHe sat down and Cosette, after serving him some wine, returned to her place under the table. But before she could start her knitting, she heard Mme Thenardier\'s angry voice demanding, \'Where\'s the bread I told you to get?\'\n\nCosette, who had forgotten about the bread, came out from under the table.\n\n\'The baker\'s was shut,\' she lied.\n\n\'Well, give me back the money.\'\n\nCosette felt in her pocket and suddenly went pale. The coin was not there.\n\n\'I\'m waiting,\' Mme Thenardier said threateningly.\n\nCosette said nothing, speechless with fear as the woman raised her arm to hit her. But before she could deliver the blow the old man, who had seen everything, interrupted her.\n\n\'Madame, I\'ve just noticed this on the floor. It must have fallen from the child\'s pocket.\'\n\nMme Thenardier took the coin the old man held towards her and walked away.\n\nAt that moment the door opened and Eponine and Azelma appeared. They were two healthy girls, the old man noticed, dressed in warm clothes and with pink, healthy cheeks. After hugging and kissing their mother, they sat on the floor by the fire and played with a doll. Cosette, who had returned to her place under the table, looked up from her knitting and watched them sadly. A short time later, the girls grew bored with their game. They left the doll on the floor and went off to play with a baby cat. Cosette, checking that no one was watching, reached out and picked up the doll. She turned her back on the room and began to play with it, hoping that no one could see what she was doing. Her happiness did not last long, however. The two girls, when they saw Cosette with their doll, ran crying to their mother. Mme Thenardier rushed across the room towards Cosette who, afraid that she would be punished, put the doll gently on the floor and began to cry.\n\n\'What\'s the matter?\' the old man said, rising to his feet.\n\n\'Can\'t you see?\' Mme Thenardier said, red with anger. \'That nasty little girl, who isn\'t even my own daughter, who I feed and look after out of the kindness of my heart, has been playing with my daughters\' doll.\'\n\n\'I don\'t understand,\' the old man said.\n\n\'She\'s touched it with her dirty hands!\' Then, hearing Cosette crying, she turned to the little girl and shouted, \'Stop that noise!\'\n\nThe old man left the inn and, minutes later, returned with something in his hands: the beautiful doll from the stall across the road.\n\n\'Here,\' he said softly, placing it gently on the floor in front of Cosette. \'It\'s for you.\'\n\nThere was a sudden silence in the room. Mme Thenardier, Eponine and Azelma stood absolutely still. The drinkers at the other tables paused, glasses half-way to their lips, and stared with disbelief.\n\n\'What kind of man is this?\' they thought. \'He dresses so poorly but can afford to buy the most expensive doll in Montfermeil!\'\n\nThe Thenardiers gave the old man their best room for the night. The next morning they gave him the bill, charging him three times the usual price for a meal and a bed for the night. They waited nervously while the man studied the bill carefully, expecting him to complain or cause trouble. Finally, he looked up from the bill without expression and said, \'Tell me, is business good here in Montfermeil?\'\n\n\'Times are very hard,\' Mme Thenardier replied immediately. \'This is a poor country. I don\'t know how we would manage without the occasional rich and generous traveller like yourself. We have so many expenses. That child, for instance - you\'ve no idea how much she costs. We have our own daughters to look after. I can\'t afford to look after other people\'s children, too.\'\n\n\'What would you say,\' the old man said after a moment\'s thought, \'if I offered to take the child from you?\'\n\n\'Oh!\' Madame Thenardiers face brightened. \'That would be wonderful.\'\n\n\'Just a minute,\' her husband said. \'We love that child very much. It\'s true we\'re poor, and we have bad debts, but love is more important than money.\'\n\n\'How much do you need?\' the old man asked, taking an old leather wallet from the pocket of his coat.\n\n\'1500 francs,\' Thenardier, who had already done his arithmetic, replied.\n\nThe old man put three 500-franc notes on the table and said, without smiling, \'Now fetch Cosette.\'\n\nWhen Cosette came downstairs, the old man gave her new clothes to wear: a black woollen dress, black stockings, scarf and shoes. Half an hour later, the people of Montfermeil saw an old man in a tall hat and long yellow coat walking along the road to Paris, hand-in-hand with a little girl dressed completely in black. No one knew the man. And, because she was carrying an expensive doll and was no longer wearing rags, not many recognized Cosette.\n\nCosette was leaving at last. She did not know where to, or with whom. But, as she held the old man\'s hand, she gazed wide-eyed at the sky. She had the strange but comforting feeling that she was somehow travelling closer to God.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30892, 11701),
(30895, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo \n\nPart 5\n\nValjean and Cosette\n\nSomewhere on the outskirts of Paris, Jean Valjean stopped outside a large, ancient building with damp walls. He took a key from the pocket of his long yellow coat and opened the old wooden door. He then carried Cosette, who was sleeping in his arms, along a dark corridor and up some stairs to the room he had rented since his escape from Montreuil. There was not much furniture in the room – just an old bed, a mattress on the floor, a table, some chairs and a lighted stove. A streetlamp shone through the only window, lighting the dark interior of the room.\n\nValjean laid Cosette on the bed without waking her. He lit a candle and sat by the bed, watching her while she slept. He felt sad that Fantine had not lived to see her child again, but happy that he had been able to rescue her child from the terrible Thenardiers. He bent and kissed the sleeping child’s forehead just as, nine months earlier, he had kissed her mother’s.\n\nThe next morning, Cosette opened her eyes and immediately started to get out of bed.\n\n‘I’m coming, Madame,’ she yawned, blinded by the bright winter’s sunlight that was shining into the room.\n\nThen, as her eyes adjusted to the light, she saw the kind old face of Jean Valjean looking down at her, and she relaxed.\n\n‘Of course!’ she cried with joy. ‘It’s all true. I was afraid that it was just a dream.’\n\nShe hugged her doll and asked Valjean hundreds of questions. Finally, she asked him, ‘Do you want me to sweep the floor?’\n\n‘No,’ he said. ‘I just want you to enjoy yourself.’\n\nThe December days passed in great happiness for Cosette and for Jean Valjean, too. For twenty-five years he had been alone in the world. Nothing had ever touched his heart until he had rescued Cosette. Now, he discovered the greatest joy he had ever known by just standing beside her bed and looking at her innocent, trusting little face. He had discovered love.\n\n***\n\nAfter escaping from Montreuil, Jean Valjean had taken all his money from the bank and buried it in a forest near Montfermeil. Although he was rich, he had chosen a room in a poor part of Paris, where nobody would find him. His only neighbour was an old woman, who did his housework and kept his stove burning. Paying her six months in advance, he told her that he was a ruined Spanish gentleman, and that the little girl was his granddaughter.\n\nWeeks passed, and the two lived happily. Valjean gave Cosette lessons in reading and writing, and spent hours watching her as she dressed and undressed her doll. To avoid being seen, he never went out during the day. He walked for a couple of hours every evening, sometimes alone, sometimes with Cosette. He often gave money to beggars, which was unwise, because he soon became known in the area as ‘the beggar who gives money to beggars’.\n\nOne evening, towards the end of winter, Valjean gave some money to a beggar sitting under a streetlamp outside a church. The beggar raised his face and stared hard at Valjean for just a second, then quickly bowed his head. This gave Valjean a shock. Although he had only seen the beggar’s face for a second, it had seemed strangely familiar.\n\n‘I’m going mad,’ he thought, as he walked home.\n\nThe next evening he returned to the steetlamp outside the church. The beggar was still there, in the same position, wearing the same clothes. This time, Valjean spoke to him as he gave him some money. The beggar laughed and joked with him, and Valjean returned that evening a happier man.\n\n‘I must have been dreaming yesterday,’ he laughed to himself. ‘But for a second, there was something about the beggars eyes that reminded me of Javert. How could I have thought such a thing? After speaking to him this evening, I can see that he doesn’t look like the inspector at all.’\n\nA few evenings later, while he was giving Cosette a reading lesson in his room, Valjean heard the front door of the house open and close. This was unusual. The old woman, the only other person who lived in the building, always went to bed before nightfall. Valjean signalled to Cosette to keep quiet. Someone was coming up the stairs. He blew out the candle and, just as he was kissing Cosette on the forehead, the footsteps stopped. Valjean did not move. He sat in his chair with his back to the door and held his breath. A few minutes later, having heard only silence, he turned round. A light was shining through a crack in his door. Someone with a candle was standing outside his room.\n\nSeveral minutes passed, and then the light disappeared. Valjean quietly lay down on the mattress on his floor, but he could not close his eyes all night. At daybreak, as he was falling asleep at last, he heard footsteps in the corridor outside his room again. Running to the door, he put his eye to the large keyhole and saw the back view of a man who was walking towards the stairs. A tall man in a long coat with a stick under his arm.\n\nValjean’s heart almost stopped beating and he began to sweat.\n\n‘Javert,’ he breathed to himself.\n\n***\n\nValjean spent all day making preparations to leave. It was too dangerous for him and Cosette to stay there another night. That evening, he went downstairs and looked up and down the street. It seemed empty, although he could not see into the shadows behind the trees. He went back upstairs for Cosette, who was waiting for him patiently, holding her doll.\n\n‘Come along,’ he said. ‘It’s time to leave.’\n\nCosette took his hand, and went with him down the stairs.\n\nThere was a full moon, and this pleased Valjean as he moved quickly along the narrow streets. By keeping close to the walls in the shadows, he could clearly see what was happening in the light. After a while, he felt confident that he and Cosette were not being followed. But, as the church bells of the city struck eleven o’clock, something made him look back. In the light of a lamp above a doorway, he saw four men moving along the street in his direction. He gripped Cosette’s hand and began to walk more quickly. Every few minutes, he stopped in the shadows of a doorway or at the corner of a street to look back. The four men were still following him. He could see their faces clearly in the moonlight, and one of them belonged to Inspector Javert.\n\nBy now, Cosette was exhausted. Valjean picked her up and ran with her through a confusing system of alleys until he came to a bridge. On the other side of the river, he stopped at the entrance of a high-walled alley and looked back. He could see four figures in the distance on the far side of the bridge.\n\nWalking more slowly now, thinking he was safe from his pursuers, Valjean followed the alley until he came to a lane that seemed to lead away from the city. He walked along this lane for a long time until, to his horror, he discovered his way blocked by a high wall. There was no way forward, but as he was turning back, he saw movements in the distance and the flash of moonlight on metal. Seven or eight soldiers were moving slowly along the lane in his direction.\n\nValjean looked desperately for an escape from the alley, but could see none. On one side of him was a tall building, all its doors and windows covered with metal bars. On the other side there was a wall, higher than a tree. He would be able to climb the wall on his own, but how could he carry Cosette? Suddenly, he had an idea. He ran to a nearby streetlight and pulled some wire from a metal box at its base. He tied one end of the wire around Cosette’s waist, climbed the wall and, with great difficulty, pulled the girl up behind him. He was only just in time. There was a tree on the other side of the wall, and Valjean carried Cosette down into its branches just as the soldiers arrived.\n\n‘He must be here!’ He heard Javert’s voice clearly on the other side of the wall. ‘He can’t have escaped. There’s no way out!’\n\nAt last, the soldiers gave up their search and went back in the direction they had come. Valjean hugged Cosette tightly with relief, knowing that at last they were both safe.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30894, 11701);

(30897, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Part 6 Marius On the night after the Battle of Waterloo, in June 1815, a robber moved quietly around the battlefield, stealing money and jewellery from the bodies of dead soldiers. He saw a hand sticking out from a pile of dead men and horses, a gold ring on its middle finger, shining in the moonlight. The robber took the ring but, as he turned to leave, the hand grabbed his jacket. The robber pulled the body from the pile of bodies and saw that he had rescued a French officer. The man had a terrible wound in his head, but he was still alive. \'Thank you,\' the officer whispered. \'You\'ve saved my life. What\'s your name?\' \'Thenardier,\' the robber replied. \'I shall not forget that name,\' the officer replied. \'And you must remember mine. My name\'s Pontmercy.\' Without another word, the robber took the wounded man\'s watch and purse, and disappeared into the night. Georges Pontmercy was married with a young son. He survived the Battle of Waterloo but unfortunately, in the same year, his wife died. His father-in-law, M. Gillenormand, was a very wealthy man, but the two men hated each other. M. Gillenormand hated everybody who liked Napoleon. He thought that Pontmercy was no better than a beggar, a penniless adventurer who only wanted his money. Pontmercy thought that M. Gillenormand was an old fool. When his daughter died, M. Gillenormand made Pontmercy an offer which he could not refuse. \'You have no money, and I am rich,\' he said. \'If you want to keep your son, Marius, I\'ll give you no money. But if you give the boy to me, and promise never to see him again, I\'ll look after him.\' Pontmercy, wanting his son to have a good life, had sadly given him to M. Gillenormand and never saw his son or father-in-law again. Marius grew up with his grandfather, and never knew his father. M. Gillenormand always told him that his father had been no good - that he was a poor soldier and a drunk who had abandoned him after his mother\'s death. For many years, Marius believed this, but when he was seventeen years old, he learnt the truth. His father, a brave officer who had fought for Napoleon and nearly died at the Battle of Waterloo, had really loved him and his mother very much. Without telling his grandfather, Marius tried to contact his father and finally discovered where he was living. He went at once to visit him, but he was too late. His father had just died. A poor man, Georges Pontmercy had left his son nothing apart from a letter: For my son. My life was saved at Waterloo by a sergeant. His name was Thenardier. I believe that he recently managed a small inn in the village of Montfermeil, not far from Paris. If you ever find this man, I want you to help him in any way you can. Marius returned to Paris, but continued to visit his father\'s grave regularly, without telling his grandfather. One day, however, his grandfather discovered what he was doing. They had a big quarrel, and M. Gillenormand ordered Marius to leave his house. *** For the next three years, Marius lived in a small room in an old, damp-walled building on the outskirts of Paris - the same room that Valjean and Cosette had lived in eight years earlier. He gave up studying law and earned his living by working in a bookshop and helping to write dictionaries. He did not earn very much money, but it was enough for the rent and simple meals. He rarely bought new clothes, but he was proud of the fact that he had never been in debt. His grandfather often tried to send him money, but Marius always returned it. He hated his grandfather for the unjust, cruel way he had treated his poor father. Life was hard for him, but he never forgot the promise he had made his father: that he would find Thenardier, the man who had saved his father\'s life, and help him in any way he could. Marius was a handsome young man, but he was also extremely shy. When girls looked at him and smiled, he thought they were laughing at his old clothes. In fact, they were attracted by his good looks, but he was not confident enough to realize this. As a result, he had no girlfriend, but he was happy with his books. \'You shouldn\'t stay alone all the time,\' his good friend, Enjolras, said to him. \'You should get out more. Give the girls a chance. They\'d be good for you, Marius. Otherwise you\'ll turn into a priest!\' Marius paid little attention to his friend, and continued his quiet life of work, study and daily walks. While walking around his part of the city, Marius had noticed in elderly man and a young girl in the Luxembourg Gardens. They always sat next to each other on the same bench. The man, who was perhaps sixty, had white hair and a serious but friendly-looking face. The girl, who was aged thirteen or fourteen, always wore the same badly-cut black dress. She was very thin, almost ugly, but Marius noticed that she had lovely blue eyes. They seemed to be father and daughter. Marius saw this couple frequently on his regular walks in the Gardens. But, although he was very interested in them, they seemed not to notice him at all. The girl was always talking happily, while the man said very little. He just looked at the girl from time to time with an affectionate, fatherly smile. Enjolras had often seen the couple, too. \'Do you know who they are?\' Marius asked him one day. \'I call the man M. Leblanc, because of his white hair, and the girl Mile Lanoire, because of her black dress,\' his friend replied. *** For almost a year, Marius saw the old man and the young girl daily in the same place at the same time. Then, for some reason, Marius stopped going to the Luxembourg Gardens. When he returned, one summer morning six months later, he saw the same couple sitting on the same bench, but something amazing had happened. The man was the same, but the thin, plain girl of six months earlier had become a beautiful young woman. Her rough black dress had been replaced by one of fine black silk. She had soft brown hair, pale, smooth skin, deep blue eyes and a lovely smile that lit up her face like sunshine. She looked up when Marius passed for the second time, and gave him a casual glance. Marius, however, walked on, thinking of other things. For the next few days he passed the bench in the Gardens without looking at her. Then one day, as he was passing, thinking about nothing in particular, the girl looked up at him and their eyes met. A second later she looked away and Marius walked on but, in a strange way, he knew his life had changed. What he had experienced in that moment was not the honest, innocent gaze of a child. It was something more than that. Whatever it was, Marius sensed that, after that moment, his life would never be the same. The next day, Marius returned to the Luxembourg Gardens wearing his best clothes. He walked around slowly, stopping to look at the ducks on the lake, then casually approached the bench where Mile Lanoire and her father were sitting. As he walked past, he kept his eyes fixed on the girl, but she did not seem to notice him. She was talking quietly to her father, and Marius could hear the soft, exciting murmur of her voice. Without intending to, he stopped, turned round and walked past the bench again. He felt his face go red and his heart beat loudly in his chest. He was sure, this time, that she had watched him as he passed. He did not go back a third time, but sat down on a bench at the opposite end of the Gardens. He looked at the girl out of the corner of his eye. She seemed to fill the far end of the Gardens with a kind of blue mist. Taking a deep breath, he rose and was going to pass the bench for a third time when he stopped. He suddenly realized that, in his feverish state, he had forgotten about the old man. What would he be thinking when he saw a strange young man walking backwards and forwards in front of his bench? Without another thought, Marius left the Gardens and went home. He returned the next morning and sat on a bench all day, pretending to read a book, not daring to go near the bench where the girl and her father were sitting. He did the same every day for two weeks. Towards the end of the second week, while Marius was sitting in his usual place, he looked up from his book. And his face went pale. Something had happened at the far end of the Gardens. M. Leblanc and his daughter had risen from their bench and were slowly walking in his direction. Marius shut his book, opened it again and made an effort to read. When he felt that they were near him, he looked up and saw that the girl was looking steadily at him with a soft, thoughtful gaze that made him tremble from head to foot. He gazed after her until she had disappeared from sight, then rose to his feet and walked around, laughing and talking to himself. Finally he left the Gardens in the mad hope of seeing her in the street, but instead he met Enjolras, who invited him to a meal. Every day for the next month, Marius went to the Luxembourg Gardens, excited by knowing that the girl was secretly looking at him, but too shy and embarrassed to know what to do. He avoided walking directly in front of the bench, partly from shyness, partly because he did not want to attract her father\'s attention. Sometimes he stood for half an hour in a place where her father could not see him, looking at her and enjoying the small, secret smiles she sent him. But it seemed that M. Leblanc had begun to suspect what was happening because often, when Marius appeared, he got to his feet and walked away, taking his daughter with him. Sometimes M. Leblanc took his daughter to a different bench, to see if Marius would follow them. Marius failed to understand the trick, and made the mistake of doing so. Then M. Leblanc became irregular in his visits and did not always bring his daughter with him. When this happened, Marius did not stay in the Gardens, which was another mistake. Marius was too much in love to think clearly. His desire for the girl was growing daily, and he dreamt of her every night. One evening, he found a handkerchief lying on the bench which M. Leblanc and his daughter had just left. It was a plain, white handkerchief with the initials U.F. in one corner. \'Ursula.\' Marius said the first name that came into his head. \'A delicious name!\' He kissed the handkerchief, breathed in its perfume, wore it next to his heart by day and kept it under his pillow at night. \'I can feel her whole soul in it!\' he told himself In fact, the handkerchief belonged to M. Leblanc and had simply fallen out of his pocket, but Marius was unaware of this. He never appeared in the Luxembourg Gardens without the handkerchief pressed to his lips or his heart. The girl could not understand his behaviour at all, and looked at him with a puzzled expression. \'Such modesty!\' Marius sighed. Eventually, Marius was not satisfied with just knowing the girl\'s name; he wanted to know where she lived. He found that she lived in a small house at the quiet end of the rue de l\'Ouest. As well as the joy of seeing her in the Gardens, he now had the pleasure of following her home. One evening, having followed them to the house and watched them enter, he went in after them and spoke to the concierge. The concierge, however, became suspicious, thinking that Marius was connected with the police, and refused to say anything. The following day, M. Leblanc and his daughter did not come to the Gardens at all. They did not come for a whole week, and Marius began to feel depressed. Every night he stood outside their house and gazed up at their lighted windows. Sometimes he saw a shadow pass in front of a lamp, and his heart beat faster. On the eighth night there was no light in the windows. Marius waited, his heart aching with pain, until finally going home. The next day they did not go to the Gardens, so again Marius went to the house as night was falling. Once again, there were no lights in the windows. He knocked on the door and spoke to the concierge. \'Where\'s the old gentleman?\' he asked. \'He\'s left.\' Marius felt the blood leave his face. Almost fainting, he asked in a weak voice, \'When did he leave?\' \'Yesterday.\' \'Where has he gone?\' \'I\'ve no idea.\' \'Did he leave an address?\' The concierge then recognized Marius from the previous week. He stared fiercely at him and said, \'So, it\'s you again! I was right. You are some kind of policeman.\' With those words he slammed the door in Marius\'s face.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30896, 11701),
(30899, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Part 7 The Jondrettes Summer and autumn passed, and winter came, but Marius saw no sign of M. Leblanc or \'Ursula\'. He searched everywhere for them, but without success. He became like a homeless dog, wandering the streets in a mood of dark despair. Without \'Ursula\', his life had become meaningless, work disgusted him, walking tired him, solitude bored him. \'If only I hadn\'t followed them home,\' he told himself. \'It gave me so much happiness just to look at her, and now, through my stupidity, I\'ve lost even that.\' Enjolras and his other friends tried to cheer him up by taking him to exciting places, but these expeditions always ended in the same way: Marius would leave the group and walk around the streets of Paris unhappily on his own. One cold but sunny afternoon in February, Marius was walking along the street when two young girls dressed in rags ran into him. One was tall and thin, the other smaller. From what they were shouting at each other, he understood that they were running from the police. He stood for a moment staring after them as they disappeared round a corner. Then he noticed a small parcel of papers lying on the ground. Realizing that one of the girls must have dropped it, he picked it up and called after them, but it was too late. The girls had already disappeared from sight. With a sigh, he put the package in his pocket and went on to dinner. That night at home, Marius opened the package and found that it contained four letters, all addressed to different people, and smelling strongly of cheap tobacco. Marius read the four letters and discovered that they were all asking for money. However, there was something strange about them: although they all seemed to be written by different people, they were written on the same rough paper in the same handwriting. He also noticed that each of them had similar spelling mistakes. Thinking no more about it, he wrapped the letters up again, threw them into a corner and went to bed. The next morning, while he was working, there was a gentle knock on his door. \'Come in,\' Marius said, expecting it to be the concierge, Mme Bougon. But the voice that answered, saying, \'I beg your pardon, Monsieur,\' was not that of Mme Bougon. It was more like the voice of a sick old man. Marius looked up quickly and saw that his visitor was a thin girl wearing just a skirt and shirt. She looked cold and ill, and when she spoke, Marius saw that she had lost several of her teeth. There was, however, still a trace of beauty in the sixteen-year-old lace, like pale sunlight beneath the thick clouds of a winter\'s dawn. Marius rose to his feet, sure that he had seen the girl somewhere before. \'What can I do for you, Mademoiselle?\' he asked. \'I\'ve got a letter for you, M. Marius.\' Marius opened the letter and read: My warm-hearted neighbour, I have heard of how you kindly paid my rent for me six months ago. I thank you for it. But my eldest daughter will tell you that my wife is sick and none of us have had any food for four days. Please, Monsieur, show us the kindness of your generous heart again. My daughter is at your service. Yours truly, Jondrette. Marius realized at once that the handwriting, the yellow paper and the smell of cheap tobacco was the same as in the four letters he had read the previous evening. He now had five letters, all the work of one author: the man who lived with his family in the next room. The Jondrette family had been Marius\'s neighbours for many months, but he had never before paid much attention to them. This was why he had failed to recognize the two daughters when they had run into him on the street. But now he understood that Jondrette\'s business was writing dishonest letters, asking for money from people he imagined were wealthier than himself. Marius looked up from the letter and watched the girl moving fearlessly around his room, studying the furniture and the mirror on the wall. Her eyes lit up when she noticed the books on his writing desk. \'Books!\' she said, and then added with pride, \'I know how to read and write. Look, I\'ll show you.\' Picking up a pen that lay on the table, she wrote on a piece of paper, Be careful! The police are coming! She showed Marius her work and then, changing the subject quickly, for no reason at all, she gazed into his eyes and said shyly, \'Do you know, M. Marius, that you\'re a very handsome boy?\' Approaching him, she rested a cold red hand on his shoulder and said, \'You never notice me, M. Marius, but I know you. I see you on the stairs, and I see you walking around the streets, looking so sad and alone.\' Marius\'s cheeks went red. He moved away from the girl\'s touch and said, \'I think, Mademoiselle, that I have something belonging to you.\' He handed her the parcel of letters. She clapped her hands and cried, \'We\'ve been looking for that everywhere! How did you know they were mine? Of course, the handwriting. You were the man we ran into last night.\' While she talked excitedly, she took out one of the letters. \'Ah, this is for the old man who goes to church every day. If I hurry, I might be able to catch him. Perhaps he\'ll give me enough for a dinner. We haven\'t eaten for three days... \' Marius took a five-franc piece from his pocket and handed it to the girl. \'The sun\'s come out at last!\' she cried, eagerly accepting the coin. \'That\'s enough food for two days. You\'re a real gentleman, Monsieur.\' With those words, she gave a little laugh and wave, grabbed some dry bread from the table and disappeared out of the door. *** Marius had lived for five years without much money, but he had never been really poor. Now, after his conversation with the girl from the next room, he understood what real poverty was. Only a thin wall separated him from the family of lost souls in the room next door. He had heard them and seen them, but had paid them no attention, and he suddenly felt guilty. \'If they had had another neighbour,\' he thought, \'one who had noticed their suffering, perhaps they could have been rescued by now.\' As Marius was thinking about the sad life of the family in the next room, he stared dreamily at the wall that separated them. Then, in the top corner near the ceiling, Marius saw that there was a triangular hole. \'Let\'s see what these people are really like,\' Marius thought. \'Then I\'ll be in a better position to help them.\' He stood on a cupboard, put his eye to the hole, and looked through it into his neighbours\' room. The Jondrettes\' room was dirty and evil-smelling, unlike Marius\'s bare but clean room. Its only furniture was a chair, an old table, some cracked dishes and two dirty beds, one on each side of a fireplace. A man with a long, grey beard was sitting at the table, writing a letter and smoking a pipe. A large woman with greying hair, once red, was sitting by the fire, while a thin, pale-faced child sat on one of the beds. Marius, depressed at what he saw, was going to get down from the cupboard when the door of the Jondrettes\' room opened and the elder girl came in. Slamming the door shut behind her she cried victoriously, \'He\'s coming!\' \'Who\'s coming?\' Her father looked up. \'The old man who goes to church. He\'s following me. I saw him with his daughter in the church, and gave him the letter. He said he would follow me here. I ran ahead to tell you he\'ll be here in two minutes.\' \'You\'re a good girl,\' the man said, rising quickly to his feet. Then, turning to his wife, he said, \'Quickly! Put out the fire!\' While she poured water on the flames, the man broke the chair with his foot and told his younger daughter to break a window. She put her fist through the glass and ran to her bed, crying because her arm was covered in blood. \'Excellent,\' her father smiled, tearing a piece off his shirt and using it as a bandage. \'Now we\'re ready for the kind gentleman. When he sees how miserable we are, he\'ll give us a lot of money, you\'ll see.\' Moments later, there was a gentle knock on the door. Jondrette rushed to open it, bowing almost to the ground as he did so. \'Please come in, my dear sir! Please enter, with your charming young lady.\' An elderly man and a young girl appeared in the doorway and Marius, still looking through the hole in the wall, could not believe his eyes. It was She. She! Everyone who has ever loved will feel the force of that small word. In the bright mist that clouded his vision, Marius could hardly see the features of the sweet face that had lit his life for six months and had then disappeared, filling his life with darkness. And now the vision had reappeared! When Marius had recovered some of his senses, he saw that she seemed a little paler than before. Her companion as usual was M. Leblanc. As she entered the room, she put a large parcel on the table. \'Monsieur, you will find some woollen stockings and blankets in the parcel,\' M. Leblanc told Jondrette. \'You are extremely generous, Monsieur,\' Jondrette said, again bowing to the ground. \'But as you can see, we are unfortunate in many ways. We are without food, Monsieur, and without heating. No warmth for my unhappy children. Our only chair is broken. A broken window - in this weather! My wife ill in bed and our younger daughter injured.\' \'Oh, the poor child,\' \'Ursula\' said, seeing the girl\'s bleeding wrist. \'She had an accident in the machine-shop where she works for six sous an hour, \'Jondrette explained. \'They may have to cut off her arm.\' The daughter, taking her father\'s words seriously, began to scream with fear. While M. Leblanc and \'Ursula\' tried to comfort her, Jondrette approached his wife and said in a whisper, \'Take a good look at that man.\' He then returned to M. Leblanc and told him about his debts. \'I owe sixty francs in rent,\' he said. M. Leblanc took a coin out of his pocket and put it on the table. \'Five francs is all I have with me,\' he said. \'But I\'ll take my daughter home and come back this evening with more money for you.\' Jondrette accompanied M. Leblanc and \'Ursula\' out of the door and, after a few minutes\' indecision, Marius jumped down from the cupboard and ran out into the street. But he was too late; their carriage had already gone. Miserably, he turned back to the house. He went into his room, pushing the door behind him, but the door would not shut. Turning, Marius saw that a hand was holding it open. \'What is it?\' he demanded. It was the Jondrette girl. \'So it\'s you again,\' he said almost fiercely. \'What do you want now?\' She did not reply but stood thoughtfully looking at him, seeming to have lost all her earlier confidence. She had not entered the room, but was still standing in the half-light of the corridor. \'What do you want?\' Marius repeated angrily. \'M. Marius,\' she said at last, a faint light in her sad eyes, \'you seem upset. What\'s the matter?\' \'Nothing. Now please leave me alone.\' Marius tried again to shut the door, but she still held it open. \'You\'re making a mistake,\' she said. \'You aren\'t rich, but you were generous this morning. You\'ve been kind to us - now I want to be kind to you. Is there anything that I can do?\' Marius considered her offer, then had an idea. Moving closer to her, he said, \'Do you know the address of those people who\'ve just left your room?\' \'No.\' \'Can you find out for me?\' \'Is that what you want?\' she said, a disappointed look on her face. \'Yes.\' The girl looked hard at him for a minute. \'What will you give me?\' she said at last. \'Anything you want.\' \'Anything?\' \'Yes.\' \'Then I\'ll get it.\' She left immediately, closing the door behind her. Marius sat down and buried his face in his hands, too overcome by emotion to think clearly. But then he heard a loud voice from the next room. \'I tell you I\'m sure.\' Jondrette was speaking to his wife. \'I recognized him.\' Without another thought, Marius jumped on to the cupboard and looked again through the hole in the wall. \'Really?\' His wife looked puzzled. \'Are you sure?\' \'Of course I\'m sure. It\'s been eight years, but I recognized him at once.\' He told the two girls to leave the room and then, when alone with his wife, he said, \'And I recognized the girl too. I\'m surprised you didn\'t.\' \'Why should I? I\'ve never seen her\' But Jondrette bent down and whispered something in her ear. Straightening up, he said, \'Now do you recognize her?\' \'Her?\' said the woman, her voice filled with sudden hatred. \'Are you sure? That\'s impossible!\' she cried. \'Our daughters barefoot and without a dress between them, while she wears leather boots and a fur coat? You must be wrong. You\'ve forgotten, that child was ugly, and this one\'s not bad-looking.\' \'I tell you, it\'s the same girl. You\'ll see. And I\'ll tell you another thing. She\'s going to make us a fortune. I\'m tired of being poor. We deserve a better life, and this is our chance.\' \'What do you mean?\' \'He said he\'ll be here at six o\'clock, with sixty francs. I\'ll bring some friends round, and we\'ll make sure he gives us a lot more money.\' \'What will you do if he doesn\'t give you more money?\' Jondrette stroked his beard and laughed. \'We\'ll know what to do about it.\' And then, as he was going to leave the room, he turned to his wife and said, \'You know, it\'s lucky he didn\'t recognize me. If he had, he wouldn\'t be coming back here again. It\'s the beard that saved me - my lovely, long, romantic beard!\' With an ugly laugh, he pulled his cap down over his eyes and left the room. *** Although Marius was a dreamer and not a man of action, he knew immediately that he had to save M. Leblanc and \'Ursula\' from the trap that Jondrette was setting for them. But what could he do? He could not warn M. Leblanc because he did not know the old man\'s address. There was only one thing to do: he had to tell the police. Half an hour later, Marius was at the nearest police station. The desk clerk showed him into the police chief\'s office, where a tall man with a wide face and a thin, tight mouth was trying to keep warm next to a fire. \'Are you the chief of police?\' Marius asked. \'He\'s away,\' the tall man said. \'I\'m Inspector Javert. Now, what do you want?\' Marius told Javert about the morning\'s events. When he told Javert his address, he noticed the inspector\'s eyes light up with great interest. Then, when everything had been explained, Javert thought for a moment. Finally, he asked Marius for his door key and told him to go home and hide quietly in his room so that his neighbours would think he was out. \'Take these with you,\' the inspector went on, producing two small guns. \'When the old man and the girl arrive, let them start their business. When you think it\'s getting dangerous, shoot one of these guns. After that, I\'ll take charge.\' Back in his room, Marius sat down nervously on his bed. It was nearly six o\'clock. Outside it had stopped snowing, and a full moon was growing steadily brighter above the mist. Suddenly, he heard voices. Taking off his boots, he quietly climbed on to the cupboard and looked through the hole in the wall. A fire burned in the corner of the room, filling it with blood-red light. Jondrette, who had just come in, was shaking snow from his shoes. \'Everything\'s arranged,\' he said. \'Has the concierge gone out?\' \'Yes,\' his wife said. \'And you\'re sure he\'s not in next door?\' \'Positive.\' \'Good.\' Then he turned to his daughters. \'Now, you two must go and keep guard in the street, one by the gate, one at the street corner.\' \'A fine job!\' the elder girl called back. \'Keeping guard barefoot in the snow.\' \'Tomorrow you\'ll have fur boots!\' her father called out after her. A few minutes later, there was nobody in the building except for Marius and the Jondrettes. Marius watched as Jondrette put a metal bar in the fire and inspected a rope ladder on the table. Next, he opened a drawer, took out a long knife and tested its blade with his finger. Suddenly, at exactly six o\'clock, the door into the Jondrettes\' room opened. \'Welcome, Monsieur, \'Jondrette said, rising to his feet. M. Leblanc appeared and put four coins on the table. \'That is for your rent and food, Monsieur,\' he said. \'Now we must discuss what else is needed.\' Jondrette quietly told his wife to dismiss the carriage, and when she had left the room, turned back to his visitor. \'How is the wounded child?\' M. Leblanc asked him. \'Not well.\' Jondrette smiled sadly. \'She\'s in great pain. Her sister has taken her to hospital, but they\'ll be back soon.\' The conversation continued politely in this way for several minutes. M. Leblanc asked Jondrette about his circumstances, and Jondrette smiled sadly as he invented lie after lie. Finally, Jondrette picked up a large picture that was leaning against the wall, and showed it to M. Leblanc. \'What\'s that?\' M. Leblanc said, looking at the badly-drawn picture of a soldier in uniform. \'It\'s a work of art,\' Jondrette informed him. \'I love this picture as much as I love my two daughters. But, unfortunately, I have to sell it. What do you think it\'s worth?\' \'It\'s just an old inn-sign. It\'s worth about three francs.\' \'I\'ll accept a thousand,\' Jondrette softly replied. M. Leblanc rose and, standing with his back to the wall, looked quickly round the room. Jondrette was on his left, his wife was standing on his right near the door. Jondrette put the picture down and stepped quietly towards the old man. \'You don\'t recognize me, do you?\' he said in a loud, clear voice. At this signal, which he had pre-arranged with his friends, three men armed with metal poles rushed into the room. M. Leblanc grew pale, and gripped the back of the broken chair with his huge hands. Marius, meanwhile, raised his right hand with the gun, ready to fire the warning shot. \'The carriage is ready?\' Jondrette asked the three men. \'Yes, with two good horses,\' one of them replied. \'Excellent.\' He turned to M. Leblanc and repeated his earlier question. \'You still don\'t recognize me, do you?\' \'No.\' \'My name isn\'t Jondrette. It\'s Thenardier. Now do you recognize me?\' M. Leblanc trembled slightly, but still shook his head. Marius, however, who had been going to fire the gun as a signal for the police to arrive, shook so much that he almost fell off the cupboard. \'Thenardier,\' he thought. \'That\'s the name of the man who saved my father\'s life at the Battle of Waterloo. The man I\'ve promised to help!\' If he fired the warning shot, M. Leblanc would be saved and Thenardier would be destroyed. But he would also have broken his promise to his father. He felt his knees grow weak. What should he do? Thenardier walked up and down in front of M. Leblanc. \'Do you remember the little inn in Montfermeil eight years ago? You took away our Cosette, do you remember? Wearing that old yellow coat, pretending you were a tramp! Well, now you\'re going to learn that you can\'t make things right by just bringing a few hospital blankets! You\'re the cause of all my troubles. For 1500 francs you took away a girl who was bringing me lots of money.\' \'I don\'t know what you\'re talking about,\' M. Leblanc said. \'I don\'t know who you are, but I know what you are. You\'re a dirty criminal.\' \'A criminal?\' Thenardier said, suddenly angry. \'That\'s what you rich people call people like me, isn\'t it? Just because I\'ve failed in business. I was a war hero, you know - I saved an officer\'s life at Waterloo! And you call me a criminal! Well, I\'m going to teach you a lesson.\' He began to move towards M. Leblanc, but the old man was too quick for him. With surprising speed, he pushed the table and chair to one side and ran to the window. He managed to open it but, before he could jump, the three men jumped on him and held him to the floor. This was too much for Marius. \'Forgive me, father,\' he murmured, preparing to fire the gun. But suddenly Thenardier cried, \'Don\'t hurt him!\' After a long fight, M. Leblanc was tied up and taken to the bed. \'No wallet?\' Thenardier cried, having searched his pockets. \'Never mind.\' He sat on the bed next to the helpless but brave old man, and said, \'Let\'s discuss things quietly. All I\'m asking for is 200,000 francs. I realize that you don\'t have the money with you now, but I want you to write a letter. I\'ll tell you what to say.\' He untied M. Leblanc\'s right hand and, producing a pen and paper, began: My dearest daughter, You must come at once. I need you urgently. The person who gives you this note will bring you to me. I shall be waiting. M. Leblanc signed his name Urbain Fabre, which seemed to satisfy Thenardier, and wrote an address on the envelope. Thenardier then took the letter and gave it to his wife. \'There\'s a carriage outside. Don\'t be long.\' Nearly half an hour passed. Thenardier seemed lost in his own dark thoughts. The prisoner did not move. Finally, there was the sound of horses in the street outside and, moments later, the door to the room was thrown open. \'It\'s a false address,\' Mme Thenardier cried. \'There\'s no Urbain Fabre. The old man\'s been lying to us!\' Thenardier sat on the corner of the table in silence for some moments, swinging his leg and gazing with a fierce satisfaction at the fire. Then he turned to the prisoner and said in a slow, threatening voice, \'What did you hope to gain by giving me a false name and address?\' \'Time!\' cried the prisoner in a loud voice, jumping from the bed, having secretly cut the ropes that tied him. Before the others in the room could react, M. Leblanc was standing by the fire, holding a metal bar above his head. \'I\'m not afraid of you,\' he said. \'But neither should you fear me.\' With those words he threw the metal bar out of the window into the street below. \'Get him!\' Thenardier shouted. \'He\'s defenceless.\' Two men grabbed him by the shoulders. \'Now cut his throat!\' Thenardier called. Marius stared, frozen with fear as Thenardier, knife in hand, stood hesitating a few steps away from the prisoner. The brave man was in terrible danger, but Marius still could not fire the gun. Then, in the moonlight, he saw the solution to his problem. On top of the cupboard, by his feet, he noticed the piece of paper that the elder daughter had written on: Be careful! The police are coming! He immediately saw what he had to do. He took a piece of brick from the wall, wrapped the piece of paper around it and threw it through the hole into the middle of Thenardier\'s room. He was just in time. Thenardier was advancing towards his prisoner, knife in hand, when his wife cried, \'Something fell!\' She picked up the piece of paper and handed it to her husband, who read it quickly. \'It\'s Eponine\'s handwriting!\' he cried a moment later. \'Quick! Get the ladder. The police are coming and we\'ve got to go!\' They threw the rope ladder from the open window but, before they could escape, the door opened and Inspector Javert walked in. \'Relax,\' he smiled. \'You can\'t escape through the window. There are five of you, and fifteen of us. You have no chance. Why not come quietly?\' The men put down their weapons and surrendered without a fight. When everybody had been arrested and taken from the room, Javert noticed the prisoner, who was standing, head bowed, by the window. He turned to speak to another policeman but, when he looked back, he saw that the prisoner had gone. Javert rushed to the open window and looked down. The rope ladder was swinging gently above the empty street. \'He must have been the cleverest of them all, \'Javert murmured angrily to himself.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30898, 11701);

(30901, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Part 8 Marius and Cosette Not wishing to give evidence against Thenardier in court, Marius made immediate arrangements to leave his room. Early the following morning, he paid the concierge his final rent and went to live with his friend, Enjolras. Inspector Javert looked for Marius everywhere, but without success. Two months later, Marius was deeply unhappy. He sent money every Monday to Thenardier, who was in prison, which meant that he had even less money for himself. But the main reason for his unhappiness was that he was forced to live his life with no hope of seeing \'Ursula\'. One afternoon he was sitting in a field, looking down at a small river, when his dreams of \'Ursula\' were suddenly broken by the sound of a familiar voice. He looked up and recognized Eponine, Thenardiers elder daughter. Still wearing the same rags, with the same bold look in her eyes and the same rough voice, she had somehow become more beautiful. She stared at Marius with a look of pleasure on her pale face, and for some moments seemed unable to speak. \'So at last I\'ve found you,\' she finally said. \'I\'ve been looking for you everywhere. You aren\'t living in the same room any more?\' \'No,\' said Marius. \'Well, I can understand that. It\'s not nice, that sort of thing. But why are you wearing that dirty old hat? \'When Marius gave no answer, she went on, \'And you\'ve got a hole in your shirt. I\'ll mend it for you. A young man like you ought to be nicely dressed.\' Marius still said nothing, and after a moments pause she said, \'You don\'t seem very glad to see me, but I could make you look happy if I wanted to!\' \'How?\' said Marius. \'What do you mean?\' \'You weren\'t so unfriendly last time.\' \'I\'m sorry, but what do you mean?\' She bit her lip and hesitated, as if trying to make up her mind about something. Finally, she said, \'I\'ve got the address.\' Marius\'s heart seemed to miss a beat. \'You mean \'The address you wanted me to find out. The young lady, you know...\' Her voice sank into a sigh. Marius jumped up and took her by the hand. \'Let\'s go at once!\' he cried, wild with excitement. Then he suddenly frowned and seized Eponine by the arm. \'But you must promise me,\' he said, \'that you\'ll never tell your father the address.\' \'I promise,\' the girl replied, staring at Marius with amusement. They had only gone a few steps when Eponine stopped and said, \'You remember you promised me something?\' Marius felt in his pocket. All he had in the world was the five-franc piece he intended to give her father in prison. He pushed it into her hand, but she opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground. She looked at him with a mixture of disappointment and sadness in her eyes. \'I don\'t want your money,\' she said. *** That evening, Cosette was alone in the house which Jean Valjean had bought about a year earlier. It was a small house in a back street, with a large, wild garden. Valjean had gone away on business for a couple of days, and Cosette was in the downstairs sitting room, playing the piano. Suddenly, she thought she heard the sound of footsteps in the garden. She listened at the window for a minute, then ran up to her bedroom, opened the window and looked out. The moonlit garden and the street beyond it were completely empty. Cosette, not a nervous girl by nature, smiled to herself and thought no more about it. The next evening, as she was walking in the garden, she was sure that she heard someone moving in the trees. Again, when she looked round, she saw nothing. When Jean Valjean returned from his business the following day, Cosette told him about the noises in the garden. He told her not to worry, but she noticed an anxious look in his eyes. He spent the next two nights walking around the garden, checking the gate, listening for noises, but nothing unusual happened. Then one morning, a few days later, Cosette noticed a large stone lying on the garden bench. Nervously, she picked it up and discovered an envelope underneath it. Inside, there was a small notebook filled with love poems. Cosette sat down and began to read, enjoying the music of the language and the beauty of the handwriting. She had never read anything like this before, and it affected her deeply. Her heart on fire, she took the notebook upstairs to her bedroom and read every word again. She remembered the handsome young man she had seen so often in the Luxembourg Gardens. As she read the notebook, she knew in her heart that he was the author of these beautiful, romantic words. Finally, she kissed the book, held it to her heart and waited for the evening, when she knew that something special was going to occur. That evening, Jean Valjean went out. Cosette spent a long time in front of the mirror, making her hair look beautiful and deciding which dress to wear. Finally, she went out into the garden. She sat on the bench where she had found the notebook and, moments later, had the strange feeling that she was being watched. She looked round and jumped to her feet. It was He! He looked paler and thinner than she remembered. His dark clothes were almost invisible in the shadows, and his face shone softly in the fading light. Cosette felt suddenly faint, but she did not move or make a sound. \'Forgive me for being here.\' Marius spoke at last. \'But I\'ve been so unhappy. Do you recognize me? You mustn\'t be afraid. It\'s a long time ago, but do you remember the day when you first looked at me - in the Luxembourg Gardens? And the day you walked past me? Those things happened nearly a year ago. Forgive me for talking like this, I don\'t know what I\'m saying - perhaps I\'m annoying you? But the truth is, I can\'t live without you.\' \'Mother!\' Cosette murmured, and began to fall. Marius caught her and held her tightly in his arms without realizing what he was doing, lost in a mist of love. Cosette, feeling her body close to his, took his hand and pressed it against her heart. Aware of the shape of the notebook under her dress, he said, \'So, you\'ve read my notebook. Do you love me, too?\' \'Of course,\' she answered in a low voice. \'You know I do.\' Then, as if by magic, her lips were next to his and they were kissing. Afterwards, they sat together on the garden bench in a state of shock, neither of them speaking. Beneath the stars, they were happy just to look into each others eyes and hold each other\'s hands. Then, at last, they began to speak. They talked all evening about their dreams, their mistakes, their moments of happiness, their moments of despair. When everything had been said, she laid her head on his shoulder and asked, \'What\'s your name?\' \'My name\'s Marius. And yours?\' \'Cosette.\' During that month of May in the year 1832, Cosette and Marius met every day in the wild garden of that small, secret house. They would sit and hold hands and talk, or just gaze into each other\'s eyes and smile. \'How lovely you are,\' Marius would sigh. \'There are moments when I think this is a dream. There are other moments when I think I\'m a little mad. I love you so much.\' To which Cosette would reply, \'I love you more with every minute that passes.\' In this way, bathed in happiness, they lived untroubled by the world. *** One beautiful, starry evening, Marius found Cosette sitting unhappily in her garden. \'What\'s the matter?\' he asked, sitting next to her on the bench. \'My father said that we may have to leave,\' she replied. Marius trembled. For six weeks, he had known nothing but uncomplicated happiness. Now, for the first time, there was a cloud in the clear blue sky of his life. He could not speak, and Cosette felt his hand grow cold. She asked, as he had done, \'What\'s the matter?\' He replied, in a voice so low that she could hardly hear it, \'I don\'t understand what you mean.\' \'Father told me this morning that I have to pack everything and be ready to leave for England within a week.\' Marius rose to his feet and said coldly, \'Cosette, are you going?\' She looked up at him, her pale face lined with misery. \'What else can I do?\' she cried. \'So you\'re leaving me.\' \'Oh, Marius, why are you being so cruel to me?\' Marius turned his back to her and said, \'Then I shall have to go away.\' \'No, Marius, wait. I\'ve got an idea.\' Marius turned and was surprised to see her smiling. \'What is it?\' \'If we go, you must come too. I\'ll tell you where, and you must meet me there, wherever it is.\' \'How can I possibly do that?\' he cried. \'Are you crazy? You need money to go to England, and I haven\'t got any. I haven\'t told you, Cosette, but I\'m a poor man. I wear a cheap hat, my jacket has lost half its buttons and there are holes in my boots.\' He turned away from her and stood with his face pressed to the trunk of a tree, almost ready to faint. He stayed in that position for some time. Finally, he heard a small sound behind him and, turning round, he saw that Cosette was in tears. He fell on his knees in front of her and pressed her hand to his lips. \'Don\'t cry,\' he said. \'I cannot let you leave me. I promise you that if you leave me, I shall die. But listen to me - I have a plan. Don\'t expect me here tomorrow.\' \'Why not?\' Cosette said, drying her tears. \'A whole day without seeing you! That\'s unbearable!\' \'It\'s worth losing a day together if we want to be happy for the rest of our lives.\' \'But what are you going to do?\' \'Wait until the day after tomorrow. I\'ll tell you then. But until then, I must give you my address. I\'m living with a friend of mine, Enjolras.\' Marius then took a knife out of his pocket and scratched his address on the wall - 16, rue de la Verrerie.\' \'Please, Marius,\' Cosette said as she watched him. \'Where are you going tomorrow evening? I won\'t be able to sleep if you don\'t tell me.\' \'I\'m going to try something.\' \'Well, I\'ll pray for you to succeed and I\'ll never stop thinking about you. I\'ll ask no more questions, but you must promise to be here early the day after tomorrow. Not later than nine o\'clock.\' \'I promise,\' Marius said. *** M. Gillenormand, Marius\'s grandfather, was now ninety years old. He was unhappy about many things - about losing his teeth, about the political situation but, most of all, about the fact that he had not seen his grandson for four years, since their big quarrel. Although he was too proud to admit he was wrong, and although he was angry, M. Gillenormand hoped that Marius, whom he still loved, would return one day. One evening in June, M. Gillenormand was sitting in front of a large fire, staring into the flames and thinking bitterly of Marius. He was feeling depressed, because he realized that he would probably never see his grandson again. While he was gazing into the fire, thinking these sad thoughts, his old servant entered the room and asked, \'Will Monsieur receive M. Marius?\' For a moment all the blood seemed to leave M. Gillenormand\'s face, and the servant began to worry that his master was ill. But the old man finally raised his head and said, in a low voice, \'Show him in.\' Marius stood uncertainly in the doorway. The poor condition of his clothes could not be seen in the half-darkness of the room. Nothing of him was clearly visible except his face, which was calm and serious, but strangely sad. M. Gillenormand stared at his grandson with disbelief. At last! After four years! Was it really him? He wanted to open his arms and hug him, but all he said was, \'What have you come for?\' Marius murmured something in embarrassment. \'I can\'t hear you,\' the old man said, looking annoyed. \'Have you come to apologize? Do you now see that you were wrong?\' \'No, Monsieur.\' Marius lowered his eyes. \'Well then,\' the old man shouted, \'what do you want?\' \'Monsieur, I ask you to have pity on me. I know I\'m not welcome here, but I have come to ask for only one thing. Then I\'ll go away at once.\' \'You\'re a young fool,\' the old man said. \'Who said you had to go away? You left me - your grandfather! - to join in those street protests against the government, I suppose. You\'re probably in trouble with the police, or you\'re in debt, and you\'ve run back to me for help \'Monsieur, it\'s none of those things.\' \'Well, what is it exactly that you want?\' \'I have come to ask your permission to get married.\' The old man paused for a moment before saying, \'So, you want to get married at the age of twenty-one. I suppose you\'ve got some sort of career, now? Perhaps you\'ve made a fortune. What do you earn as a lawyer?\' \'Nothing.\' \'Well then, I imagine the lucky girl must have money.\' \'She\'s no richer than I am.\' \'What does her father do?\' \'I don\'t know.\' M. Gillenormand turned away with disgust. \'So that\'s it. Twenty-one years old, no job, no money. Your wife will have to count the sous when she goes to the market, won\'t she?\' \'I beg you, Monsieur,\' Marius cried. \'I love her so much. Please allow me to marry her!\' The old man gave a high, unpleasant laugh. \'So you said to yourself, \"I\'ll have to go and see him, that old fool. He\'ll be so happy to see me that he won\'t care who I marry. I haven\'t a pair of shoes, and she hasn\'t a shirt, but never mind. I\'m going to throw away my youth, my career, my whole life, and dive into poverty with a woman around my neck... \" That\'s what you think, isn\'t it? Well, my boy, you can do whatever you want. But I will never give you my permission! Never!\' \'Grandfather \'Never!\' The tone of his grandfather\'s voice robbed Marius of all hope. He rose and crossed the room slowly, with his head bowed. He had just reached the door, however, when M. Gillenormand moved quickly towards him, pulled him back into the room and pushed him into an armchair. \'Tell me about it,\' he said to Marius, who stared back with silent amazement, unaware that the word \'grandfather\' was responsible for the change in the old man\'s behaviour. \'Come on, tell me about your love affairs. Don\'t be afraid to talk. Don\'t forget, I\'m your grandfather. Here... \' he said, taking a purse from a drawer and putting it on the table. \'Here\'s some money for you. Buy yourself some new clothes.\' Marius told his grandfather all about Cosette and how much he loved her. M. Gillenormand listened carefully and, when Marius had finished, he laughed. \'You must enjoy yourself when you\'re young,\' he said. \'But you must also be sensible. Don\'t get married yet, that\'s my advice. Have fun with the girl, but don\'t marry her. Make her your lover but not your wife.\' Marius, too shocked to reply, shook his head and rose to his feet. He then turned slowly to the old man, bowed deeply and said, \'Four years ago you insulted my father. Today you have insulted my future wife. I shall ask no more favours of you, Monsieur. Goodbye.\' M. Gillenormand called for Marius to come back, but it was too late. The proud young man had closed the door and gone. \'Oh my God,\' the old man cried, burying his face in his hands. \'What have I done? This time he\'ll never come back.\' *** Marius left his grandfathers house in a state of despair, and returning to his room, fell asleep fully-dressed on the bed. When he woke up, Enjolras was in the room with a few other friends. They all looked very nervous and excited about something. \'What\'s the matter?\' Marius asked sleepily \'Are you coming to the funeral of General Lamarque?\' \'Who\'s he?\' Enjolras and his friends shook their heads with amazement at their friend\'s lack of awareness, and soon left the room. Marius opened a drawer and took out the two guns which Inspector Javert had lent him in February. Putting them in his jacket pocket, he went out and continued to wander aimlessly around the streets, noticing only occasionally the strange atmosphere of excitement that was growing in the town. People were running around, and there was a lot of noise, but Marius paid little attention. He could think of only one thing: his meeting later that evening with Cosette. This would be his last brief happiness; after that, there would be only darkness. At nine o\'clock that evening, Marius crept into the garden of Cosette\'s house, but she was not there waiting for him as she had promised. Looking up, he saw that there were no lights on in the house and that all the windows were closed. Unable to control himself, he beat his fists against the walls of the house. \'Cosette!\' he cried, not caring who heard him. \'Where are you?\' He called her name again and again until, exhausted, he sat down on the stone steps. Now she was gone, he told himself, he had no future. There was nothing for him to do except die. Suddenly he heard a voice calling through the trees from the street. \'M. Marius!\' He looked up. \'Who\'s that?\' \'Is that you, M. Marius?\' \'Yes.\' \'Your friends are waiting for you at the barricade in the rue de Chanvrerie.\' Marius ran to the gate and was just in time to see the figure of Eponine, Thenardier\'s daughter, disappearing into the shadows at the end of the street.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30900, 11701),
(30903, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Part 9 The Barricade In the spring of 1832, the people of Paris were ready for revolution. Charles X, who had become king in 1824, believed that he had total power over the French people. He was a strong supporter of the Catholic church and the aristocracy, and he took away the freedoms that Napoleon had given the ordinary citizens. Although this made him very unpopular, he thought that his opponents would be too weak to prevent him from doing what he wanted. He was wrong. In 1830, there was a peaceful revolution, and he was forced to leave. The new king, Louis-Philippe, was a brave and clever man who loved his country. The ordinary people liked him at first, but he soon showed that he was more interested in power for his family than democracy for his people. He understood business, but he could not understand the problems of poor people. Neither could he understand the concept of freedom of speech, and he often sent soldiers into the streets to attack people who were making public protests. As the summer approached, the mood of the workers and the poor became angrier and angrier. Their anger exploded into violence in June 1832, when General Lamarque died. The General had been very popular with the people of France because of his love for Napoleon. The day of his funeral was arranged for 5 June, and thousands of people saw this as a chance to make a public protest against the king and his government. At first, the funeral went quietly. Soldiers accompanied the coffin as it was carried slowly across Paris. A large crowd followed behind, waving flags and carrying swords and heavy sticks. The crowd grew more and more excited, until finally they tried to take the coffin away from the soldiers and carry it across a bridge. Their exit was blocked by more soldiers on horseback. For a moment, nothing happened. Then there were two gunshots. The first shot killed the commander of the soldiers guarding the exit to the bridge. The second killed a deaf old woman who was trying to shut her window. Then the fighting started. Soldiers attacked the crowd with swords; the crowd threw stones and ran screaming across the bridge. Minutes later, the sounds of war echoed across the whole city of Paris. *** As soon as the fighting started, Enjolras and several of his friends started to build a barricade outside the Corinth wine shop in the rue de la Chanvrerie, a small street surrounded by dark alleys in the market district of Paris. Enjolras had been joined by many strangers as he and his friends had run shouting along the street. There was a tall, grey-haired man whom nobody knew, but whose strong, brave face had impressed everybody. There were several street children, excited by the sound of battle, who also joined them. One of these children was Eponine, who had dressed like a boy so that no one would tell her to go home. Having run to tell Marius that his friends were waiting for him, she was helping Enjolras and his companions to build the barricade. New people arrived all the time, bringing with them gunpowder and weapons to fight the soldiers who would be arriving very soon. Enjolras, who was the leader of the rebels, organized the building of a second barricade and the manufacture of bullets from melted silver. The tall, grey-haired man was doing useful work on the larger barricade, and Eponine (whom everyone thought was a boy) worked hard too. The barricades were finished in less than an hour and, with the sound of drums in the city growing louder, Enjolras brought a table out into the street and sat down with his friends for a drink. Night fell, but nothing happened. While the fifty men behind the barricade waited impatiently for the arrival of sixty thousand soldiers, Enjolras approached the tall, grey-haired man. \'Who are you?\' he asked. When the man said nothing, Enjolras became suspicious. \'You\'re a policeman, aren\'t you?\' he said. The man smiled and eventually admitted that he was. \'My name\'s Javert,\' he said. Before he could move, Enjolras ordered four men to search him. When they found a letter in his pocket which proved that he had been sent to spy on them, they tied him to a post inside the inn, \'You\'ll be shot two minutes before the barricade falls,\' Enjolras informed him. *** Marius left the garden and, mad with grief at losing Cosette, walked towards the sound of drums and gunfire in the centre of the city. He had only one thought in his mind: he wanted to die. Marius pushed his way through the crowds of frightened, murmuring people that filled the streets until he reached the market area. Here, he found the unlit streets suddenly filled with soldiers. Unafraid, Marius ran through the shadows, ignoring shouts for him to stop. Someone fired a gun and a bullet hit a wall just behind him, but he didn\'t care. He was just approaching the rue de Chanvrerie when he heard a loud voice calling from the shadows: \'Who\'s there?\' \'The French Revolution!\' he heard a distant voice reply - the voice of his friend, Enjolras. Marius stood behind an alley wall, hidden in the shadows. Around the corner, he could see a row of soldiers aiming their guns down the rue de Chanvrerie, waiting for the order to fire. \'Fire!\' the order finally came. The street was lit with a sudden flash of light and filled with the thunder of gunfire. Then the soldiers attacked. Marius stood up and ran along a series of alleys that led into the rue de la Chanvrerie, behind the Corinth wine shop. When he reached the stronghold, soldiers were already climbing the barricade, shooting at the rebels. Marius saw a soldier attacking Enjolras, who had fallen backwards and was calling for help. Marius took Javert\'s guns from his pockets and shot the soldier dead. Soldiers now occupied the top of the barricade, but were unable to advance any further because the defenders fought so fiercely. Marius, who had thrown away his guns and was now without a weapon, began to move towards a barrel of gunpowder he had seen near the door of the wine shop. He did not notice a soldier aiming his gun at him. Neither did he see, at the moment the soldier fired, a young boy dressed in rags jump in front of the gun and fall wounded as the bullet meant for Marius hit him in the hand. \'Put down your weapons and surrender!\' a soldier called from the top of the barricade. \'Fire!\' Enjolras shouted. The soldiers and the rebels fired at each other at the same time, filling the air with thick clouds of dark smoke. When the smoke cleared, there were many dead bodies on both sides. The survivors were reloading their guns in silence, when suddenly a loud voice called, \'Get out now, or I\'ll blow up the barricade!\' All heads turned to stare in the direction of the voice. Marius was standing at the foot of the barricade, holding a flaming torch above a barrel of gunpowder. \'If you blow up the barricade,\' a sergeant called, \'you\'ll blow up yourself as well!\' Marius smiled and lowered the torch towards the gunpowder. Within seconds, the soldiers had left the barricade, leaving their dead and wounded behind, and were running into the darkness at the far end of the street. Enjolras threw his arms around Marius\'s neck. \'So you\'ve come!\' he cried. Marius hugged Enjolras and many other friends he recognized. While the soldiers waited at the far end of the street for further orders, and the rebels removed dead bodies from the barricade and took care of the wounded, Marius walked around the stronghold in a kind of dream. After two months of happiness with Cosette, he was now in the middle of a war. He could not believe this was happening to him. He was so confused that he did not recognize Javert, tied to a post inside the inn throughout the battle. As he was walking by the smaller barricade, his thoughts were interrupted by a weak voice calling his name from the shadows. \'M. Marius!\' He looked about him but, seeing no one, he started to walk away, thinking that he was imagining things. \'M. Marius!\' He heard the voice again. Marius gazed into the shadows, but could still see nothing. \'I\'m at your feet,\' the voice said. Looking down, Marius saw a dark shape crawling along the ground towards him. By the light of a lamp on the pavement, he could see a torn jacket, trousers with holes in them, and two bare feet. A white face was turned towards him and the voice asked, \'Do you recognize me? It\'s Eponine.\' Marius bent down quickly, and saw that it was indeed that unhappy girl, dressed in a man\'s clothes. \'What are you doing here?\' he said. Then, noticing the pool of blood on the ground behind her, cried, \'You\'re wounded! I\'ll carry you to the inn. They\'ll take care of you there. Is it very bad?\' She showed him the bullet hole in her hand. \'A soldier was going to shoot you,\' she said, her voice no more than a whisper. \'But I put my hand in front of his gun.\' \'You poor child,\' Marius said. \'We\'ll put a bandage on that wound immediately. You\'ll be all right.\' \'The bullet passed through my hand,\' Eponine murmured, \'but it came out through my back. It\'s no use trying to move me, but I\'ll tell you how you can treat my wound better than any doctor. Sit down on that stone, close beside me.\' Marius sat next to her. She rested her head on his knee and said without looking at him, \'Oh, what happiness. Now I don\'t feel any pain,\' For a moment she was silent. She pressed her hand to her chest, from which blood was pouring like dark wine. Then, with a great effort, she raised herself on one arm and, struggling for breath, looked into Marius\'s eyes. \'I can\'t cheat you,\' she said at last. \'I have a letter for you in my pocket. I\'ve had it since yesterday. I was asked to post it, but I didn\'t. I didn\'t want you to get it. But now we\'re both going to die, it doesn\'t matter, does it? I can\'t be jealous any more. Take your letter.\' She took hold of Marius\'s hand with her wounded hand and, without seeming to feel the pain, guided it to her pocket, from which he took the letter. \'Now you must promise me something for my trouble,\' she said. \'You must kiss me on the forehead after I\'m dead... I shall know.\' She let her head fall back on his knees. Her eyelids trembled, and then she was still. Just as Marius thought that her sad soul had finally left her body, she slowly opened her eyes, and said in a voice so sweet that it seemed already to come from another world, \'You know, M. Marius, I think I was a little bit in love with you.\' With those words, she closed her eyes for the last time and died. Marius kissed her pale forehead and laid her gently on the ground. Then he returned to the wine shop, and opened the letter that she had given him. By candlelight he read, My dearest, We are leaving this house at once. We go tonight to Number 7, rue de l\'Homme-Arme, and in a week we shall be in England. Cosette, 4 June. Marius covered Cosette\'s letter with kisses. So she still loved him! He thought for a moment that now he must not die, but then he thought, \'She\'s going away.\' She was going with her father to England, and his grandfather had refused to give his permission for him to marry. Nothing had changed, and he decided that he had one last duty to perform: he must send Cosette a final message and tell her of his death. He tore a page out of the pocket notebook he always carried and wrote: Our marriage was impossible. I went to my grandfather, and he refused to give his permission. I have no money, and neither have you. I hurried to see you, but you had gone. You remember the promise I made you. I shall keep it. I shall die. I love you. When you read this, my soul will be very near and smiling at you. He folded the letter, wrote Cosette\'s new address on the back and called over a young boy. \'What\'s your name?\' he asked the boy. \'Gavroche.\' \'Well, Gavroche, will you do something for me? I want you to deliver this letter to the address written on the outside.\' The boy scratched his head, thought for a moment, and then, with a sudden movement, took the letter and ran off into the night.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30902, 11701),
(30905, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Part 10 The Letter Jean Valjean, at that moment, was in a state of terrible shock. For the first time in their life together, he and Cosette had quarrelled. She had not wanted to leave the house, but she had eventually obeyed him. They had left quickly, at nightfall, bringing their servant, Toussaint, with them, but very little luggage. Cosette had brought her letter case and blotter with her, Valjean his box of child\'s clothing and the old National Guard uniform which all respectable men possessed, and which he had worn under a previous identity. In their new house, they went to bed in silence. Cosette, however, did not leave her bedroom the next day, and Jean Valjean had dinner alone. As he was eating, Toussaint told him about the fighting in the city, but he did not pay much attention. He was too worried about Cosette. There was no reason, he thought, why they should not continue to live happily together in England. As long as he had Cosette, he would be happy, and it did not matter where they lived. He began to feel happier as he thought about the journey they would soon be making. He stood up and was going to leave the room when something made him stop. He glanced again at the mirror. Cosette\'s blotter was lying on a cupboard just below it and, as Valjean stared at its reflection, he read the following lines: My dearest, We are leaving this house at once. We go tonight to Number 7, rue de 1\'Homme-Arme, and in a week we shall be in England. Cosette, 4June. In her unhappy state of mind, Cosette had forgotten to remove the page that she had used to blot the letter she had written to Marius. She had left it on the cupboard and the mirror, reflecting the backwards handwriting, made the message clearly visible. Valjean moved closer to the mirror and read the lines again, not wanting to believe them. But there was no doubt that this was Cosette\'s handwriting. He began to shake and he fell back into an armchair, feeling angry and betrayed. He had suffered terribly over the years and, until now, he had survived every disaster. But this was the worst thing that had ever happened to him - someone was threatening to rob him of the only person he loved! He murmured to himself, \'She\'s going to leave me,\' and the pain of those words cut into his heart like a knife. After a short time, he rose to his feet and looked again at the blotter. His anger and misery of minutes before had been replaced by a terrible calmness. He stared at the blotter, coldness in his eyes, the darkness of the deepest night in his heart. He remembered clearly the young man in the Luxembourg Gardens who had shown such great interest in Cosette, and he was certain that this was the man she had written to. He went out into the night and sat on the doorstep, his heart filled with a terrible hatred for the man who was trying to steal Cosette from him. He sat for a long time listening to the sound of distant gunfire in the city, wondering how to get his revenge, when suddenly he heard footsteps. Looking up, he saw a pale-faced boy, dressed in rags, studying the numbers of the houses in the street. Seeing Valjean on his doorstep, the boy stopped and asked, \'Do you live in this street?\' \'Yes. Why?\' \'I\'m looking for Number Seven. I have a letter for a girl who lives here.\' \'Well, I\'m the girl\'s father. You can give the letter to me. Oh, and one more thing before you go,\'Valjean said when the boy had handed him the letter. \'Where should I take the reply?\' \'That letter comes from the barricade in the rue de la Chanvrerie,\' the boy replied. \'Which is where I\'m going now. Goodnight citizen.\' Jean Valjean went back into the house and tried to make sense of the words that danced before his eyes: I shall die... When you read this, my soul will be very near... This was enough to fill his hate-filled heart with sudden joy. So, the problem was solved! The man who threatened his happiness was going to die - was perhaps already dead. Then Valjean frowned and, after a quick calculation, decided that Marius was probably still alive. But it made no difference. He was still certain to die, and Valjean\'s happiness would be safe. If he kept the letter in his pocket, Cosette would never know what had happened to the other man, and life with her would continue the same as before. What happiness! But his happiness had no sooner returned than it disappeared again in a cloud of despair. In his heart he knew he had no choice. For the sake of Cosette\'s happiness, he would have to try and save the life of the man she loved - the man he hated more than any other in the world. Half an hour later he left the house, dressed in his National Guard uniform, with a loaded gun and a pocket full of gunpowder, and made his way towards the market district of Paris. *** During the night, the thirty-seven remaining rebels strengthened the main barricade and made more bullets. The ground floor of the wine shop became a hospital for the wounded, and the bodies of the dead were taken to an alley near the smaller of the two barricades. Four of the dead people were National Guards, and their uniforms were removed. After a long discussion with his friends, Enjolras decided that the married men (there were five of them) had to leave. \'It\'s your duty not to die,\' he told them. \'You must return to your families.\' \'How can we leave?\' they protested. \'We\'re surrounded. The soldiers will shoot us as soon as they see us.\' \'You can wear these.\' Enjolras pointed to the National Guard uniforms that had been taken off the dead soldiers. \'But there are only four,\' Marius observed. \'Then one of us must stay and fight,\' one of the married men replied. A long argument followed, during which each of the married men tried to persuade the others to go. Finally, someone shouted to Marius, \'You decide which one must stay.\' Marius went pale at the thought of having to choose which man had to die. He stared down at the four uniforms but, as he did so, a fifth uniform fell as if by magic at his feet. Looking round, Marius recognized Cosette\'s father. Jean Valjean, who had arrived unnoticed at the barricade, had been listening to the argument and had quickly understood the situation. \'Now you can all leave,\' he said. The sky grew lighter, but not a door or window was open in the street. The barricade was stronger than it had been for the first assault, and the rebels were at their positions, guns loaded and ready for action. They did not have long to wait. Sounds of chains and of heavy wheels moving along the stone streets could be heard, and then soldiers came into view at the end of the street, pulling a large cannon. The rebels fired their guns but, when the smoke had cleared, they saw the soldiers, unharmed, steadily aiming the cannon at the barricade. Moments later, an officer shouted a command and the cannon roared into action. The cannonball crashed into the bottom of the barricade with a loud explosion, but did little damage. The rebels clapped and cheered. More soldiers moved into position at the end of the street, behind the cannon, and started to build a low wall with pieces of broken stone. At the same time, the leader of the gun crew adjusted the aim of the cannon. \'Heads down!\' Enjolras shouted. The next cannonball exploded against the wall at one end of the barricade, killing two men and wounding three. \'We mustn\'t let that happen again,\' Enjolras said. He aimed his gun over the barricade at the leader of the gun crew, and fired. The gunner - a fair-haired, handsome young man - spun round twice with his head thrown back, and fell sideways across the cannon. Blood poured from the middle of his back. A tear rolled down Enjolras\'s cheek. \'It\'s sad,\' he murmured to Marius, who was standing next to him. \'He looked a brave young man.\' *** The battle continued for some time; the cannon destroyed the upper windows of the wine shop, and did some damage to the barricade, but the rebels did not withdraw. They fired back at the soldiers, killing many men. In the pauses between shooting, the rebels could hear the sound of fighting in other parts of Paris. They were filled with hope that help would come soon, but the hope did not last long. Within half an hour the sound of gunfire in other places had stopped, and the rebels knew that they were alone. When a second cannon was moved into position next to the first, they knew that the end was near. Both cannons fired together, accompanied by gunfire from soldiers at the end of the street and on the rooftops. As other guns began firing at the smaller barricade, the rebels fought back bravely, but they were running out of bullets. There were only twenty-six men left, and the main attack on the barricade was going to take place very soon. Some men, including Marius, stayed on the main barricade, while the others built a low stone wall around the door of the wine shop. Enjolras, inside the wine shop, turned to Javert, who was still tied to the post. \'I haven\'t forgotten you,\' he said, putting a loaded gun on the table. \'The last man to leave this place will blow your brains out.\' At this point, Jean Valjean spoke to Enjolras. \'You\'re the leader, aren\'t you? Can I ask you for a favour?\' \'You saved a man\'s life by giving him your uniform. You deserve some reward. What do you want?\' \'Let me kill this man.\' \'That\'s fair,\' Enjolras decided, when nobody objected. \'You can have your spy.\' At the same moment there was the sound of a drum, followed by a loud roar. \'They\'re coming!\' cried Marius from the top of the barricade. The rebels rushed to their positions, leaving Valjean alone with Javert inside the wine shop. Valjean untied the rope around Javert\'s feet and, taking him by the belt of his coat, led him outside. Only Marius, looking over his shoulder, saw them cross the stronghold towards the smaller barricade. Valjean, his gun in one hand, pulled Javert behind him over the barricade and into a narrow alley, where the corner of a house hid them from view. A terrible heap of dead bodies lay not far away, among them the blood-stained body of a young girl in man\'s clothes - Eponine. Javert glanced at the dead body and murmured, \'I think I know that girl. \'Then, returning his attention to Valjean, he said calmly, \'I think you know me, too. Take your revenge.\' Valjean, however, took a knife from his pocket and cut the ropes that tied Javert\'s wrists. \'You\'re free to go,\' he said. When Javert stared at him, speechless with surprise, Valjean went on, I don\'t suppose I\'ll leave here alive. But if I do, I\'m staying at Number 7, rue de l\'Homme-Arme. Now go.\' Javert buttoned his coat, straightened his shoulders and, with a puzzled look on his face, began to walk off in the direction of the market. He had only gone a few steps, however, when he turned and looked at Valjean. \'I find this embarrassing,\' he said. \'I\'d rather you killed me.\' \'Go away,\' Valjean replied. Javert walked away slowly and Valjean, waiting for him to turn a corner, fired his gun into the air and returned to the stronghold. \'It\'s done,\' he said. *** There was a roar of gunfire and the soldiers attacked, rushing towards the barricade. Many fell, but many more reached the barricade. The first assault was beaten back by the brave rebels, but the soldiers attacked again and again. Soon, the ground below the barricade was piled with dead and wounded men as the rebels and soldiers fought hand to hand. The rebels fought long and hard to defend the stronghold, but finally they had to withdraw to the low wall outside the wine shop. They stood with their backs to the door, shooting up at the soldiers who were climbing down towards them from the barricade. One by one the remaining rebels escaped into the wine shop, until only Enjolras and Marius were left outside. As the two friends moved back towards the door, fighting off the soldiers, a bullet hit Marius in the shoulder. His eyes closed and, in great pain, he felt a hand grab him as he fell. \'They\'ve taken me prisoner,\' he thought, moments before losing consciousness. \'Now I shall be shot.\' The soldiers, meanwhile, attacked the wine shop. Before long, they broke down the door and rushed inside. Enjolras and the few surviving rebels fought bravely, but the soldiers were too strong. Soon, all the rebels were dead, including Enjolras, who was the last to die. Sword in hand, surrounded by soldiers, he refused to surrender. He died in a rain of bullets with a strangely victorious smile on his lips.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30904, 11701);

(30907, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Part 11 The Sewers of Paris Marius had indeed been taken prisoner, but not by the soldiers. It was Jean Valjean\'s hand that had caught him as he fell. Valjean had taken no part in the battle. He had been looking after wounded men while bullets flew all around him. When Marius had been hit, Valjean ran to him at once, grabbed him before he fell and carried his unconscious body into a small alley behind the wine shop. Valjean lowered Marius to the ground, stood with his back to the wall and looked around him. The situation was terrible. There seemed to be no escape. On one side of him was the field of battle. On the other side was the low barricade, behind which hundreds of soldiers waited for rebels trying to escape. Both ways meant certain death. It was a situation that only a bird could have escaped from. Valjean looked desperately around him, at the house opposite, the barricade, the ground. And then he had a sudden idea! At the foot of the smaller barricade, half-hidden by broken stones and pieces of wood, there was a hole in the road covered with an iron grille. Valjean leapt forward and, using all his strength, he moved the stones and wood, opened the grille, lifted Marius on to his shoulders and climbed down into the darkness. A few minutes later, he found himself in a long underground passage, a place of absolute peace and silence. He was inside the Paris sewers. He could just see, by the grey light from the grille above his head, that he was surrounded by walls. Ahead of him lay total darkness, but he had to go on. The soldiers might discover the grille by the barricade at any moment, and come down in search of him. With Marius lying across his shoulders, Valjean walked forward into the darkness, feeling his way along the wet, slippery walls with his hands. He moved from one passage into another, slipping several times on the wet floor. He could not see where he was going, but he knew he had to follow the downward slope of the passages towards the river. He walked blindly downwards in this way for a long time, his clothes wet with the blood from Marius\'s wound, the faint whisper of the young man\'s breath in his ear. He walked in total darkness, the silence broken occasionally by the thunder of gun carriages and horses racing along the streets of Paris far above his head. Suddenly, he saw his own shadow on the floor of the passage in front of him. Looking back, he saw the distant light of a torch. He was being followed! He pressed himself against the wall, held his breath and waited. In the distance, a group of men formed a circle around the torchlight. They seemed to be listening for something, waiting for someone to move. Finally, the group of men moved off along another passage, and Valjean was left in total darkness once again. He continued his journey through the sewers. Sometimes the roof of the passages was so low that he had to bend down as he walked. His feet slipped all the time in the water on the ground, and he felt sick and faint with the terrible, airless smell. At last, exhausted, he stopped beneath a large grille that brought him much-needed light and fresh air. He laid Marius down gently at the edge of the sewer, and looked down at his face. It was covered with blood and as pale as death. Valjean tore pieces oft his own shirt and bandaged Marius\'s wounded shoulder as well as he could. Then, bending over the unconscious body, Valjean stared at Marius with hatred in his eyes. He found two objects in Marius\'s clothing: a piece of bread and a wallet. Valjean ate the bread and, opening the wallet, found a note which Marius had written: My name is Marius Pontmercy. My body must be taken to the house of my grandfather, M. Gillenormand, 6 rue des Filles-du- Calvaire, in the Marais. Valjean repeated the address until he could remember it, returned the wallet to Marius\'s pocket, picked Marius up again and continued his journey downwards towards the river. He did not know what part of the city he was passing under or how far he had come. The only thing he was sure of was that the light through the grilles far above his head was growing weaker, which meant that the sun was setting. At one point he had to walk waist-deep through water, and almost sank as the ground turned to sand beneath his feet. Finally, when even his great strength was beginning to fade, he saw ahead of him a light - the clear light of day. He was suddenly filled with new energy at the sight, at last, of his way of escape from the sewers. Forgetting the weight of Marius on his shoulders and his own hunger and tiredness, he ran towards the light. He had to bend as the roof of the tunnel became lower, but when he reached the light, Valjean stopped and gave a cry of despair. The opening was closed with a strong iron gate, held firm by a huge, rusty lock. Through the bars, Valjean could see daylight, the river, a narrow riverbank - but how could he get out? Valjean laid Marius down by the wall, where the floor was dry. Then, moving to the gate, he shook it fiercely with both hands, trying to bend the bars with the last of his strength. But the gate was solid and the bars were firm. Valjean turned his back to the gate and sank to the ground, his head bowed between his knees. There was no way out and, as all hope of escape left him, he began to think of Cosette. *** While in this state of despair, Valjean felt a hand on his shoulder. He thought he was dreaming. He looked up and saw a man dressed in old clothes standing beside him. Despite the unexpectedness of this meeting, Valjean recognized the man at once. It was Thenardier. Valjean did not show that he recognized the man, and saw with relief that Thenardier had not recognized him. \'I\'ll make a bargain with you,\' the man said. \'What do you mean?\' Thenardier nodded in Marius\'s direction. \'You\'ve killed a man. Give me half of what you found in this man\'s pockets, and I\'ll unlock the gate for you.\' He produced a large key from his pocket, and a piece of rope. \'I\'ll give you this as well,\' he said. \'Then you can tie stones to the body and throw it in the river.\' Valjean took the rope without speaking. \'What about my share of the money?\'Thenardier asked. Valjean took thirty francs from his pockets and showed it to Thenardier, who stared with disbelief. \'You killed a man for just thirty francs? You\'re a fool.\' He searched Marius\'s pockets himself, and then Valjean\'s. \'It\'s true,\' he said at last. \'That\'s all there is. Oh well. Never say that I\'m not a kind man.\' He took the thirty francs and, helping Valjean to lift Marius on to his shoulders, he put the key in the lock and opened the gate just wide enough for Valjean to pass through. When Valjean was outside, Thenardier closed the gate behind him and disappeared, like a rat, into the darkness of the sewers. *** Valjean laid Marius gently on the grass and stood up, surrounded by silence, enjoying the feeling of fresh air on his face. Then, just as he was bending to splash water from the river on Marius\'s face, he was aware of someone else standing behind him. He looked round quickly and saw a tall man in a long coat, a large stick in his hand. Although the man\'s face was hidden in shadow, Valjean recognized him as Inspector Javert. Javert, however, did not recognize Valjean at first. He had been more interested in catching Thenardier, who had escaped from prison and was known to be in the area. \'Who are you?\' he asked. Valjean told him his name and stood, without moving, as Javert approached and stared into his eyes. \'Inspector Javert,\' Valjean said quietly. \'I beg you to do me one favour. I promise not to try and escape. I gave you my address this morning, if you remember, so you would know where to find me anyway.\' Javert did not seem to hear. He stared into Valjean\'s eyes for a long time, then, stepping back with a look of confusion in his eyes, asked dreamily, \'What are you doing here? Who is this man?\' \'Will you help me to take him home?\' Valjean said. \'He\'s badly injured.\' Javert looked unhappy, but he did not refuse. Bending down, he took a handkerchief from his pocket, wet it in the river and bathed Marius\'s blood-stained forehead. Then he felt Marius\'s wrist. \'He\'s dead,\' he said. \'No, not yet,\' Valjean replied, feeling in Marius\'s jacket for the wallet. \'Look,\' he said, showing Javert the note with Marius\'s grandfather\'s address. \'That\'s where we need to take him.\' Javert shouted to the driver who was waiting for him to bring his carriage close to the river. With Marius in the back seat, Valjean and Javert side by side in the front, the carriage drove off quickly through the dark and strangely empty streets of Paris. When they arrived at M. Gillenormand\'s house, a servant answered the door. \'Does M. Gillenormand live here?\' Javert asked. \'Yes. What do you want?\' \'We\'re bringing back his grandson. He\'s dead. Go and wake his grandfather. We\'re bringing him in.\' Javert, Valjean and the driver carried Marius into the house and laid him gently on a sofa in M. Gillenormand\'s sitting-room. While one servant ran to find a doctor and another looked for clean sheets, Valjean felt Javert\'s hand on his arm. He understood, and went downstairs with Javert close behind him. When they had got back into the carriage, however, Valjean said, \'Inspector, will you do one last thing for me before you arrest me?\' \'What is it? \'Javert replied impatiently. \'Let me go home for a minute. After that, you can do whatever you want with me.\' Javert was silent for some moments, his chin sunk in the collar of his overcoat. Then he pulled down the window in front of him. \'Number 7, rue de l\'Homme-Arme,\' he told the driver. Neither man spoke during the journey. At the end of the rue de l\'Homme-Arme, which was too narrow for the carriage to enter, Javert paid the driver and accompanied Valjean to his front door on foot. \'Go in,\' said Javert, with a strange, distant look in his eyes. \'I\'ll wait for you here.\' Valjean went into his house and called, \'It\'s me!\' Climbing the stairs, he paused for a moment to look out of the window to see what Javert was doing. But the street was empty; there was no one there. The next morning, Inspector Javert\'s body was discovered floating in the river. The poor man, unable to understand the kindness and gentle nature of the man he had spent his whole life hating, had taken his own life by jumping from a bridge. It was the only way he knew to escape the confusion that was poisoning his heart. *** When M. Gillenormand saw his pale, lifeless-looking grandson lying on the sofa, he shook from head to foot. Leaning against the door for support, he murmured, \'Marius!\' \'He has just been brought here,\' said a servant. \'He was on the barricade and \'He\'s dead!\' cried the old man in a terrible voice. \'The fool! He did this to hurt me, the ungrateful boy. I try to be good to him, and this is how he rewards me!\' The old man walked to the window and, while he complained to the night about the pain and grief his grandson had caused him, the doctor arrived. After listening to Marius\'s heart, he organized his removal to a bed in another room, and returned to M. Gillenormand, who was still standing by the window. \'Will he live?\' M. Gillenormand asked, his eyes wild with fear. \'I don\'t know,\' the doctor replied. \'The wound to his body is not serious, but there are deep cuts on his head. It\'s difficult to say M. Gillenormand went to Marius\'s bedside. \'You heartless boy,\' he said angrily. \'A fool who prefers fighting to dancing and having fun. What kind of man are you? Are you mad? But it makes no difference. I too shall die. That makes you a murderer, a cold-hearted killer. I cannot feel grief for you. At that moment, Marius\'s eyes slowly opened and his gaze rested upon M. Gillenormand. \'Marius!\' the old man cried. \'Marius, my child, grandson! You\'re alive after all!\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 30906, 11701),
(30909, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Part 12 The Wedding Marius lay for a long time between life and death in a state of fever, endlessly repeating the name of Cosette. \'He mustn\'t get excited,\' the doctor warned. Every day, according to one of the servants, a white-haired, well-dressed gentleman came to ask for news of the sick man. Finally, after three months, the doctor announced that Marius was out of danger. But he had to spend the next two months resting because of the damage to his shoulder. M. Gillenormand grew happier as his grandson\'s condition improved. He did strange, unexpected things, like running up and down stairs without knowing why. He gave his neighbour, a pretty woman, a bunch of flowers, which greatly annoyed her husband. Marius, meanwhile, tried to make sense of what had happened to him. He thought about Enjolras and Eponine, and wondered why Cosette\'s father had been at the barricade. He could not understand why nobody could tell him how he had been saved. All he knew was that he had been brought to his grandfather\'s house in a carriage. He noticed his grandfather\'s tenderness towards him, but he could not forget the old man\'s unfairness and cruelty to his father, who had died penniless and unloved. Most of all, however, he thought about Cosette, and how he could find her again. \'There\'s something I have to say to you,\' Marius told his grandfather one day. \'What is it?\' \'I want to get married.\' \'But of course,\' the old man laughed. \'What do you mean - of course?\' \'That\'s understood. You will have your little girl.\' \'I don\'t understand,\' Marius said, almost speechless with amazement. \'You will have her,\' the old man repeated. \'She comes here every day in the shape of an old man who asks for news of you. While you\'ve been ill, she\'s spent her time crying and making bandages for you. I know all about her. She lives at Number 7, rue de l\'Homme-Arme. You see, I\'m not as unkind as you think. I\'ve found out that she\'s a charming girl and that she loves you. I knew you were angry with me, and I thought, \"What can I do to make him love me?\" Then I thought, \"I can give him Cosette.\" I wanted to invite her to see you, but the doctor warned me that you would probably get too excited. So I advise you, dear boy, to eat more meat and get better soon. Then you can marry your Cosette and be happy.\' Having said this, the old man burst into tears. He held Marius\'s head to his chest and they cried together. \'Grandfather,\' Marius said at last, \'I\'m feeling much better already. When can I see her?\' \'You can see her tomorrow.\' \'Why not today?\' \'All right, I\'ll fetch her today. You\'ve called me \"grandfather\"; you\'ve shown me that you love me after all. You\'ve earned your reward!\' *** Later that day, Cosette arrived at M. Gillenormand\'s house. Standing beside her on the doorstep was a white-haired man with a strangely nervous smile. M. Gillenormand showed them up to the room where Marius was waiting. Cosette stood in the doorway, overcome with happiness. She wanted to throw herself into Marius\'s arms, but was unable to move, afraid to show the world that she loved him. \'Monsieur.\' M. Gillenormand addressed Jean Valjean. \'I have the honour, on behalf of my grandson, Marius Pontmercy, to ask for your daughter\'s hand in marriage.\' Jean Valjean bowed. \'Good, then that is agreed,\' M. Gillenormand said and, turning to Marius and Cosette, he added, \'My children, you are free to love one another.\' When they were alone together, Cosette and Marius kissed. \'Is it really you?\' Cosette murmured at last. \'I can\'t believe it. I\'m so happy to see you. I was so excited today that I haven\'t even dressed up for you. I must look terrible. But why don\'t you say something? Why are you letting me do all the talking? Do you still love me? Oh, I\'m so wild with happiness \'My love...\' Marius whispered. *** The wedding was arranged for February the following year. Jean Valjean arranged everything. Having been a mayor, he knew how to solve an awkward problem: the question of Cosette\'s real family He told everybody that he was not her father, but her guardian. He also invented a dead family for Cosette, so that everybody believed she was an orphan. Valjean, as her guardian, gave Cosette a large amount of money - half a million francs - but did not tell her that the money was his. He told her that the money came from a man who preferred to remain unknown. It was arranged that the couple, who could not believe their sudden, new-found happiness, would live with M. Gillenormand after the wedding. Cosette, accompanied by Jean Valjean, visited Marius every day. Marius did not speak much to Valjean. Despite enjoying an occasional conversation with him, he found something strange about the old man. He could not believe that this was the same man he had seen at the barricade all those months ago - it seemed like a bad dream to him. But there were more important things for Marius to think about. Apart from preparing for his wedding, there were two people that he wanted to find. First, there was Thenardier. He was, without doubt, a bad man, but Marius had promised his father to find him and help him. He employed agents to find Thenardier, but without success. The only thing they discovered was that Mme Thenardier had died, and that her husband had escaped from prison and disappeared with his surviving daughter, Azelma. Second, there was the mysterious stranger who had saved his life. Marius\'s attempts to find him also ended in failure, and the true story of his escape from the barricade remained a complete mystery to him. One evening, when Marius was talking to Cosette and Jean Valjean about the mystery and his unsuccessful attempts to solve it, he became angry with Cosette\'s guardian\'s lack of interest in his story. \'The man was a hero,\' Marius said. \'Do you realize, Monsieur, how brave this man was? He rescued me from the field of battle and carried me through the sewers of Paris. He risked his life to save a dying man, and why? He was a total stranger. He did it without any thought of a reward. Oh, I wish Cosette\'s money were mine.\' \'It is yours,\' Valjean reminded him. \'I would give it all,\' said Marius,\'to find that man!\' Jean Valjean was silent. *** Cosette and Marius made a handsome couple on their wedding day. All previous unhappiness was forgotten as they kissed in the church, watched proudly by M. Gillenormand and Jean Valjean. There were flowers everywhere when they returned to M. Gillenormand\'s house for the wedding feast. It was the happiest night of Cosette\'s life, spoilt only by one thing: the fact that her guardian - whom she still thought of as her father - went home before the feast had started, saying that he felt ill. But Cosette was not unhappy for long. She had Marius, and she would be happy with him for the rest of her life! Jean Valjean, meanwhile, went home, lit his candle and went upstairs to bed. That night, however, he was unable to sleep. He remembered the little girl he had rescued from the Thenardiers ten years earlier, and felt sad that he was no longer the most important man in her life. Another man was the centre of her universe. He was proud of having helped to bring her happiness with Marius, but another thing troubled his soul: the fact that nobody, not even Cosette, knew the truth about him. That he was Jean Valjean, a criminal who had spent nineteen years in prison and who had stolen silver candlesticks from a trusting and kind-hearted bishop. He knew that if he told Cosette and Marius the truth, he would spoil everybody\'s happiness and he would lose their love and respect. On the other hand, if he continued to lie about his past, he would lose his own soul. What could he do? *** The next day Valjean visited M. Gillenormand\'s house, and asked to speak to Marius in private. Marius hugged Valjean warmly, addressed him as \'father\' and invited him to lunch, but Valjean shook his head and said, \'Monsieur, I have something to tell you.\' Marius listened quietly as Valjean told him everything about his life. Finally, in a state of shock and confusion, the young man said, \'Why have you told me all this? No one forced you to.\' \'If I had continued to keep my secret to myself, I would have destroyed my own heart,\' Valjean replied. \'Besides, I belong to no family. Cosette was the only family I ever had. Everything ended for me when she married you yesterday. She is happy with the man she loves. I tried to persuade myself that it would be better not to admit the truth about my past, but it was no use. I could not silence the voice that speaks to me when I am alone.\' Neither of them spoke for several minutes. Then Marius murmured, \'Poor Cosette. When she hears \'But you must promise not to tell her!\' Valjean interrupted. \'She\'ll be heart-broken if she hears the truth about me. I don\'t think I could bear it... \' He sank into an armchair and buried his face in his hands. \'Don\'t worry,\' Marius said at last. \'I\'ll keep your secret. But I think it would be better if you stopped seeing her.\' \'I understand,\' Valjean said, rising to leave. But at the door he half-turned and said, \'Monsieur, if you will permit me, I would like to come and see her. I wouldn\'t come often or stay very long. We could meet in that little room on the ground floor. Please Monsieur, if I can\'t see Cosette again, I\'ll have nothing left to live for. Besides, if I suddenly stopped visiting, people would become suspicious and begin to talk \'You can come every evening,\' said Marius. \'Monsieur, you are very kind,\' said Jean Valjean, shaking Marius\'s hand and leaving the room.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30908, 11701),
(30911, 'Les Miserables by Victor Hugo Part 13 The Truth at Last Marius kept his promise about not telling Cosette, and Valjean visited her every evening in a small room on the ground floor. It was cold and damp, but a fire had been lit and two armchairs had been placed in front of it. At first, Cosette could not understand why Valjean refused to meet her upstairs. When he refused to kiss her cheek, she began to feel unhappy, afraid that she had done something to offend him. She pressed his hands in hers and held them to her lips. \'Please, please be kind!\' she begged. \'I want you to come and live with us. You\'ll always be my father and I\'m not going to let you go.\' He released his hands. \'You mustn\'t call me \"father\" any more,\' he told her. \'You must call me \"Monsieur Jean\".\' \'I don\'t understand,\' she said, becoming angry. \'This is ridiculous. You\'re upsetting me very much, and I don\'t know why you\'re being so cruel.\' \'You don\'t need a father any more. You have a husband.\' \'What a thing to say!\' Cosette replied. \'Are you angry with me because I\'m happy?\' \'Cosette,\' he said, \'your happiness is the only thing that matters to me. You\'re happy now, and so my work is complete.\' With these words, he picked up his hat and left. Jean Valjean continued his evening visits, but the relationship between himself and Cosette became cooler and more distant. She stopped calling him \'father\' or asking him questions. As \'Monsieur Jean\', he gradually became a different person to her, and she began not to depend on him for her happiness. Valjean would sit looking at Cosette in silence, or would talk about incidents from their past. One evening in April, he called at the usual time but was told that Cosette had gone out with her husband. He waited in the small, damp room for an hour before sadly returning home. Over the next few days, his visits began to be interrupted by servants calling Cosette to dinner. When he arrived, he discovered that the fire had not been lit, and the armchairs had been left near the door. One evening he discovered there were no chairs in the room at all - he and Cosette had to stand in the cold for their whole meeting. Valjean realized what was happening; Marius was telling the servants not to make him welcome any more. That night he went home in despair, and the next evening he did not come at all. When Valjean did not appear for the second evening, Cosette sent a servant to his house to ask if he was well. Valjean replied that he was very well, but that he had business to attend to. He did not return to the house again, and Cosette was too busy with married life to think too much about him. She did not realize that, every evening, Valjean would walk slowly from his house until he reached the corner of the street where she lived. He would then stare at the house for several minutes, tears rolling down his cheeks, before turning round and slowly returning home. *** Marius thought it was right to exclude Valjean from Cosette\'s life. He achieved this without cruelty, but without weakness. Apart from the details about his life that Valjean had confessed to him, he knew that Valjean had killed Inspector Javert at the barricade. His private investigations into the old man\'s past had also revealed an even more disgusting fact. He had discovered that Valjean\'s money really belonged to somebody called Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy manufacturer from Montreuil who had mysteriously disappeared. He persuaded Cosette, therefore, not to use any of the money her guardian had given her, and to live on the money that he had started to earn as a lawyer. Cosette had not been happy about this. She could not understand why her father, as she still thought of Valjean, had stopped visiting her. She still loved him in her heart. But she loved her husband even more, and she gradually became used to not depending on the old man for her happiness. One evening a servant brought Marius a letter, saying, \'The writer is waiting in the hall.\' The smell of tobacco and the handwriting on the envelope was so familiar that Marius immediately thought of the Jondrettes. He read the letter quickly. It was signed \'Thenard\', and was asking for money. Marius could not believe his luck. He had tried without success to find the man who had saved his father\'s life at Waterloo, and now the man had come to him! He immediately asked the servant to show the man in. However, Marius had a shock when he saw the man - he did not recognize him at all! He was an old man with a big nose, glasses and neat grey hair. He was wearing smart black clothes, and a gold watch chain hung from his jacket pocket. \'What do you want?\' Marius asked coldly, as the stranger bowed to him. The stranger explained in great detail how he used to work for the government in foreign countries and that, now he was retired, he wanted to move to South America with his wife and daughter. Unfortunately, it was a long journey, and he needed money. \'What has that to do with me?\' \'Has M. Pontmercy not read my letter?\' Marius had only read the letter quickly, and could not remember the details, so he said, \'Go on.\' \'I have a secret to tell you, M. Pontmercy,\' the stranger said. \'I\'ll tell you the first part for nothing. I think you\'ll be interested; \'Well?\' \'The man you think is your wife\'s guardian is a murderer and a thief. His name is Jean Valjean.\' \'I know that.\' \'Did you know that he spent nineteen years in prison?\' \'I know that too.\' The stranger narrowed his eyes, trying to hide his disappointment and anger at Marius\'s calmness. Then he gave a strange smile. \'I have more information to tell you. It concerns money that belongs to your wife. It\'s a remarkable secret and I\'ll sell the information to you for 20,000 francs.\' \'I know this secret already,\' Marius said, \'just as I knew the others.\' \'10,000 francs?\' \'I repeat, you have nothing to tell me.\' \'But I need to eat, Monsieur!\' the visitor said, losing confidence. \'I\'ll tell you for twenty francs.\' \'I know it already,\' Marius said. \'I know everything. I even know your real name. It\'s Thenardier.\' The visitor laughed, but Marius went on, \'You\'re also Jondrette. And you once had an inn in Montfermeil.\' \'I deny it!\' \'You\'re a completely rotten man, but I\'ll give you this.\' Marius took a banknote out of his pocket and threw it in the stranger\'s face. \'Thank you, M. Pontmercy!\' the man said, examining the note. \'500 francs! That\'s real money. Oh well, I suppose we can relax.\' With those words, he removed his false nose, glasses and neat grey wig. \'M. Pontmercy is absolutely right,\' he said, changing his voice. \'I am Thenardier.\' He waited for a few seconds to see Marius\'s reaction. Marius, meanwhile, was grateful for finally having the chance to help Thenardier, and therefore to keep the promise he had made to his father. Thenardier\'s presence, however, offered him another opportunity; it gave him the chance to solve the mystery of Cosette\'s fortune. \'Thenardier,\' he said. \'Shall I tell you the secret that you were planning to sell me? I, too, have sources of information, and probably know more about the subject than you do. Jean Valjean, as you say, is a murderer and a thief. He\'s a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer and mayor of Montreuil, M. Madeleine. Jean Valjean, who knew the mayor\'s background, reported him to the police and took advantage of his arrest to take over half a million francs from his Paris bank. The manager of the bank told me this himself. And he murdered the policeman, Javert. I know this because I was there at the time.\' Thenardier looked puzzled for a moment, then said, \'Monsieur, I think you are mistaken.\' \'What! Are you denying what I said? Those are facts!\' \'They are incorrect, and I do not like to hear a man unjustly accused. Jean Valjean did not rob M. Madeleine, nor did he kill Javert.\' \'How do you know?\' \'First, he did not kill M. Madeleine because he was M. Madeleine! And second, he did not kill Javert because Javert killed himself. He killed himself by jumping into the river.\' \'What proof do you have?\' Marius said, wide-eyed with disbelief. \'I have all the proof here,\' Thenardier said, producing an envelope in which there were several documents and newspaper articles. \'I\'ve spent a long time discovering the truth about Jean Valjean.\' Marius studied the documents carefully, then looked up with a smile of joy. \'But he\'s a splendid man! The fortune was really his, and he\'s not a murderer or thief at all! He\'s a hero and a saint!\' \'He\'s a thief and a murderer,\'Thenardier said quietly. \'What do you mean?\' \'I told you that I do not like to see a man accused unjustly, but I do like to see a man punished for crimes he has committed.\' \'And what crimes are those?\' Thenardier sat down and told Marius about the time he had helped Valjean to escape from the Paris sewer. \'He was carrying the body of a man he had robbed and killed,\' Thenardier said. \'Look, I have a piece of cloth from the dead man\'s coat as proof.\' He produced a muddy piece of cloth and showed it to Marius, who immediately went pale and rose unsteadily to his feet. As Thenardier continued to talk, Marius opened a cupboard door and took out a coat. \'That man was me!\' Marius cried. \'And here is the coat I was wearing!\' Thenardier stared at the coat and the cloth in his hands, speechless with fear. He was even more surprised when, instead of chasing him out of the room, Marius ran towards him and pressed several thousand-franc notes into his hand. \'You\'re a terrible man,\' Marius said. \'A thief and a liar. You came here to destroy a man, but you have done the opposite. If you hadn\'t saved my father\'s life at Waterloo, I\'d report you to the police. I know that your wife is dead, but take the money and start a new life in America with your daughter. When you arrive there, I\'ll send you another 20,000 francs. Now get out. I never want to see you again!\' When Thenardier had left, unable to believe his good fortune, Marius ran to find Cosette and told her everything immediately. \'We must go to him at once,\' Marius said. \'He was the man who saved my life. We must waste no time!\' Minutes later, he and Cosette were travelling in a carriage to Number 7, rue de l\'Homme-Arme. *** Jean Valjean looked up when he heard the knock on his door and called in a weak voice, \'Come in.\' The door opened and Marius and Cosette appeared. Cosette rushed to the chair where Jean Valjean was sitting. \'Father!\' she cried, falling into his arms. \'So you\'ve forgiven me?\' Valjean whispered, hugging Cosette to him and turning to Marius. \'Cosette, did you hear what he said?\' Marius cried, tears of shame and guilt rolling down his cheeks. \'He asked me to forgive him. And do you know what he did? He saved my life and he brought me back to you. He came to the barricade to save me, just as he saved Javert. He carried me on his back through the sewers of Paris, to bring me to you. Oh Cosette, I feel so ashamed of the way I\'ve treated him!\' \'You have no need to say all this,\' Valjean murmured. \'Why didn\'t you say it yourself?\' Marius demanded. \'Why didn\'t you tell me that you were M. Madeleine and that you saved Javert\'s life at the barricade? Why didn\'t you tell me that I owed you my life?\' \'Because I thought it would be better to break away. If you had known the truth, you would have felt obliged to be good to me, a worthless criminal. That would have upset everything.\' \'What or whom would it have upset?\' Marius said. \'Well, we\'re not going to allow you to stay here on your own. You\'re going to come home with us. You\'re Cosette\'s father and mine. I won\'t allow you to spend another day here.\' \'And you can\'t refuse this time,\' Cosette agreed, sitting on Jean Valjean\'s lap and kissing his forehead. \'There\'s a carriage waiting for you. I\'m kidnapping you - by force, if necessary!\' Jean Valjean listened as she described the view from the room that would be his, the beauty of the garden, the singing of the birds, but he was listening more to the music of her voice than to the meaning of her words. Finally, he said, \'Yes, it would be delightful, but Cosette, frightened, took his two hands in hers. \'Your hands are so cold,\' she said. \'Are you ill? Are you in pain?\' \'No,\' said Valjean. \'I\'m not in pain. But \'But what?\' \'I\'m going to die soon.\' \'Father, no!\' Cosette cried. \'You\'re going to live! You must live, do you understand?\' Marius and Cosette both did their best to raise Valjean\'s spirits, to show him how much they loved and needed him, to fill him with the strength and the desire to live again. But it was too late. Valjean smiled, his eyes shining with love and happiness, but he was beginning to lose strength. \'To die is nothing,\' he murmured. \'But it is terrible not to live.\' Then, taking Cosette\'s sleeve and pressing it to his lips, he said, \'Come close to me, both of you. I love you dearly. How sweet it is to die like this. And you love me too, dear Cosette. You\'ll feel some grief for me, but not too much. I want you to have no great sorrows. You must enjoy life, my children. I\'m leaving the two candlesticks by the bed to Cosette. They\'re made of silver, but to me they are pure gold. I don\'t know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased as he looks down on me from above. I\'ve done my best. You mustn\'t forget, my children, that, despite my money, I am one of the poor.\' As he spoke, Valjean\'s breathing became more painful and he had difficulty moving his arms. But as the weakness of his body increased, his spirit grew in strength. The light of an unknown world was shining brightly in his eyes. \'Now, Cosette,\' he breathed softly, \'the time has come for me to tell you your mother\'s name. It was Fantine. You must not forget it. Your mother loved you greatly and she suffered greatly. She was as rich in sorrow as you are in happiness. That is how God balances things out. He watches us all from above and knows what he is doing among his splendid stars. And now I must leave you, my children. Love one another always. There is nothing else that matters in this world except love.\' Cosette and Marius fell to their knees on either side of him, holding back their tears. Jean Valjean\'s hands rested on their bowed heads, and did not move again. He lay back with his head turned to the sky, the light from the two silver candlesticks falling on his smiling, peaceful face. - THE END -', 1, 1, 0, '', 30910, 11701),
(30913, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 1 Bus to Las Vegas The first time I saw Terry Lennox he was sitting in a Rolls-Royce in front of a fancy restaurant, and he was very drunk. He had a young man\'s face but his hair was white as snow. You could see he was drunk by looking at his eyes; otherwise he looked like any young man who had been spending too much money in a place that was there to take your money. There was a woman beside him. Her hair was a pretty dark red and she had a distant smile on her lips. \'I have a wonderful idea, darling,\' the woman said, trying to be nice. \'Why don\'t we take a taxi to your place and get your little car out? It\'s a wonderful night for a ride up the coast.\' The man said \'Awfully sorry, but I don\'t have it any more. Had to sell it.\' He spoke clearly. \'Sold it, darling? What do you mean?\' She slid away from him, but her voice slid even further. \'I had to. Had to eat.\' \'Oh, I see.\' A piece of ice wouldn\'t have melted on her now. Right then, the car door seemed to open itself and the young man fell off the seat and landed, sitting, on the ground. So I went over and stuck my nose in their business, although it\'s always a mistake to interfere with people who are drunk. I picked him up and put him on his feet. \'Thank you so much,\' he said politely. I thought I heard an accent. \'He is so English when he\'s drunk,\' she said in a hard voice. \'Thanks for catching him.\' \'I\'ll get him in the back of the car,\' I said. \'Sorry, mister, but I\'m late for an appointment.\' She started to drive off. \'He\'s just a lost dog,\' she added. \'Perhaps you can find a good home for him.\' And then she was gone. And the guy was asleep in my arms. I carried him to my car. He was heavy. As I put him in the front seat, he woke up and thanked me again, and went back to sleep. He was the politest drunk I\'d ever met. While I drove, I looked at him once in a while. The right side of his face was one big scar that the doctors had worked on. They hadn\'t failed but they hadn\'t succeeded either. I was living that year in a house on Yucca Avenue in the Laurel Canyon area. The rent was low, partly because the owner didn\'t want a written agreement, and partly because of the steps. She was getting old and they were too steep for her. I got him up them somehow. Inside, I put him on the sofa and let him go back to sleep. He slept for an hour. When he woke up, he looked around and at me, and wanted to know where he was. I told him. He said his name was Terry Lennox and that he lived in Westwood, alone. His voice was steady. He said he could handle a cup of coffee. When I brought it, he asked me why he was here. I told him he had passed out outside a restaurant and his girl had driven off and left him. He said he couldn\'t blame her. \'You English?\' I asked. \'I lived there once. I wasn\'t born there.\' He finished the coffee and I drove him home. He didn\'t say much on the way, except that he was sorry. He had probably said it so often that it was automatic. His apartment was small and empty. There was a little furniture but no personal items at all. It didn\'t look like a place where anybody lived. He offered me a drink. I said no. When I left, he thanked me again, but not as if I had climbed a mountain for him and not as if it was nothing at all. He was shy but very polite. Whatever he didn\'t have, he had manners. Driving home, I thought about him. I\'m supposed to be tough but this one bothered me. I didn\'t know why, unless it was the white hair and the scar and the clear voice. There was no reason I should see him again, though. He was just a lost dog, like the woman said. *** It was a month later when I did see him again, about three blocks from my office. There was a police car stopped in the middle of the street, and the men inside were staring at something on the kerb. That something was Terry Lennox - or what was left of him. His shirt was dirty and open at the neck. He hadn\'t shaved for four or five days. His skin was so pale that the scar hardly showed. It was obvious why the policemen were looking at him, so I went over there fast and took hold of his arm. \'Stand up and walk,\' I said. \'Can you do it?\' He looked at me and nodded slowly. I wasn\'t even sure he recognized me. \'I\'m just a little empty,\' he said. He made the effort and let me walk him to the street. There was a taxi there. I opened the back door and got him inside. The police car pulled up. A cop with grey hair asked me, \'What have we got here?\' \'He\'s not drunk,\' I said. \'He\'s a friend.\' \'That\'s nice,\' the cop said sarcastically. He was still looking at Terry. \'What\'s your friend\'s name, pal?\' \'Philip Marlowe,\' Terry said slowly. \'He lives on Yucca Avenue in Laurel Canyon.\' The cop stared at us both. He was making a decision. It took him a little while. \'OK. Get him off the street at least.\' The police car drove away. We went to a place where you could get hamburgers that you could actually eat. I fed Lennox a couple and a bottle of beer and took him to my place. An hour later, he was shaved and clean, and he looked human again. I made two very mild drinks and we talked as we drank. \'Lucky you remembered my name,\' I said. \'Not only that,\' he said. \'I looked up your phone number, too.\' \'So why didn\'t you call? I live here all the time.\' \'Why should I bother you?\' \'Looks like you ought to have bothered someone.\' \'Asking for help isn\'t easy,\' he said. \'Especially when it\'s all your own fault.\' He looked up with a tired smile. \'Maybe I can stop drinking one of these days. They all say that, don\'t they?\' \'It takes about three years.\' \'Three years?\' He looked shocked. He turned and looked at the clock and changed the subject. \'I have a suitcase worth two hundred dollars down at the Hollywood bus station. I could get money for it. Maybe not two hundred dollars, but enough for a bus ticket to Las Vegas, and I could get a job there.\' I didn\'t say anything. \'A man I knew well in the army runs a big club there. His name\'s Randy Starr.\' Something must have shown on my face. \'Yes,\' he continued, \'he\'s part gangster but they all are, and the other part of him isn\'t bad.\' \'I can give you the bus fare and some extra,\' I said. He shook his head. \'I want you out of my hair,\' I explained. \'I\'ve got a feeling about you.\' \'You have?\' He looked down into his glass. \'We\'ve only met twice. What sort of feeling?\' \'A feeling that next time we meet, I\'ll find you in worse trouble than I can get you out of. I don\'t know why I have this feeling, but I do.\' He touched his scar gently. \'Maybe it\'s this. Makes me look like trouble, I suppose. But I got it honestly.\' \'It\'s not that,\' I said. \'It\'s this. I\'m a private detective and you\'re a problem that I don\'t have to solve. But the problem\'s there. Maybe that girl didn\'t drive away that time just because you were drunk. Maybe she had a feeling, too.\' He smiled faintly. \'I was married to her once. Her name is still Lennox. I married her for her money.\' When he saw my face, his smile disappeared. \'You\'re wondering why I didn\'t ask her for help. Did you ever hear of pride?\' \'You\'re killing me, Lennox.\' \'My pride is different. It\'s the pride of a man who has nothing else. Sorry if it bothers you.\' It bothered me and he bothered me, too, although I couldn\'t understand exactly why. Any more than I knew why a man would starve and walk the streets before he\'d sell a suitcase. Whatever his rules were, though, he played by them. I went down to the bus station and got his suitcase for him. When I came back, he said he had called his pal in Las Vegas. \'He was sore at me because I hadn\'t called him before.\' \'It takes a stranger to help you,\' I said, and put a hundred dollars in front of him. \'And take the suitcase with you. You might need to sell it later.\' \'I don\'t want it,\' he said. \'If you like, you can keep it for me.\' He changed his clothes and we went out for dinner. No drinks. Afterwards, he caught the bus and I drove home thinking about this and that. *** At nine-thirty, the telephone rang and the voice that spoke was one I had heard once before. \'Is this Mr Philip Marlowe?\' \'It is.\' \'This is Sylvia Lennox, Mr Marlowe. We met for a moment one night last month. I heard afterwards that you had been kind enough to take Terry home.\' \'I did that.\' \'I\'ve been a little worried about him. Nobody seems to know where he is.\' \'I noticed how worried you were the other night,\' I said. \'He\'s on a bus to Las Vegas.\' \'Las Vegas?\' This news seemed to cheer her up. \'How sweet of him. That\'s where we were married.\' \'I guess he forgot that,\' I said, \'or he would have gone somewhere else.\' Instead of hanging up, she laughed. It was a pretty laugh. \'Are you always as rude as this to ladies?\' \'I don\'t know that you are a lady. The man was living in the streets. He had no money, none at all. You could have found him if you\'d really wanted to. He didn\'t want anything from you then and he probably doesn\'t want anything from you now.\' \'That,\' she said coolly, \'is something you know nothing about, Mr Marlowe. Good-night.\' She was completely right, of course, and I was all wrong. But I didn\'t feel wrong then. I just felt angry.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30912, 11701);

(30915, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 2 An Englishman\'s Drink Three days before Christmas, I got a cheque on a Las Vegas bank for one hundred dollars. A note came with it. He thanked me, wished me a Merry Christmas, and said he hoped to see me soon. The surprise came at the end. \'Sylvia and I were married again. She says not to be angry with her for wanting to try again.\' I read the rest of the story on the society page of the newspaper. \'All are happy with the news that Sylvia and Terry Lennox have remarried at Las Vegas, the darlings. Sylvia is, of course, the youngest daughter of millionaire Harlan Potter. And what does Daddy think of the marriage? One can only guess. Potter is one person who never, ever, gives interviews.\' Well, I thought, if he wants her money, let him take it. I just didn\'t want to see him again. But I knew I would - if only because of the suitcase. It was five o\'clock on a wet March evening when he walked into my little office. He looked changed: older, more serious, but calmer, too. Like a man who had learned a hard lesson. \'Let\'s go to some quiet bar,\' he said, as if he had seen me ten minutes before. We didn\'t shake hands. We almost never did. Englishmen don\'t shake hands all the time like Americans do and, although he wasn\'t English, he had their manners. We went to Victor\'s. On the way, I said something stupid about his new life and he said that if he wasn\'t happy, at least he was rich. And he said that he wasn\'t having any trouble at all handling his drinking these days. \'Perhaps you were never really drunk,\' I said. At the bar we drank gin and lime, an Englishman\'s drink. Lennox said they didn\'t know the right way to make them here. I wasn\'t interested in talking about drinks, so I asked him about his pal in Las Vegas. Down my street, I said, Starr was known as a tough customer. \'Randy? In Las Vegas, he\'s a straight businessman. You should drop in and see him next time you\'re there. He\'ll be your pal.\' \'Not too likely. I don\'t like gangsters.\' \'That\'s just a word, Marlowe. We have that kind of world. The wars gave it to us and we\'re going to keep it. Randy and I and another guy were all in a little danger once together. It\'s different for the three of us.\' \'So why didn\'t you ask him for help when you needed it?\' He finished his drink and signalled for another. \'Because he couldn\'t refuse. I didn\'t want to beg from him.\' \'You begged from a stranger.\' He looked me straight in the eye. \'Strangers can keep going and pretend not to hear.\' When he finished the second drink, he drove me back to the office. From then on, it became his habit to drop in around five o\'clock. We usually went to Victor\'s. I didn\'t understand why he enjoyed being with me instead of being in his big expensive house. I asked him about that once. \'Nothing for me at the house,\' he said, drinking his usual gin and lime. \'Am I supposed to understand that?\' \'A big film with no story, as they say in the film business. Sylvia is happy enough. But not with me. In our circle, that\'s not too important. You see, the rich don\'t really have a good time. They never want anything very much except maybe someone else\'s wife, and that\'s a pale desire compared with the way a butcher\'s wife wants new curtains for the living room. Mostly, I just kill time. A little tennis, a little swimming.\' I told him it didn\'t have to be the way it was. He said I should wonder why she wanted him, not why he wanted to be there. \'You like having servants and bells to ring,\' I said. He just smiled. \'Could be. I grew up as an orphan with no money.\' I began thinking I liked him better drunk, hungry and beaten and proud. That night, he would have told me the story of his life if I\'d asked him. If I had asked, and if he had told me, it might have saved a couple of lives. It might have. *** The last time we had drinks together was in May. It was earlier than usual and the bar was nearly empty. \'I like bars at this hour,\' he said. \'I like to watch the man fix the first one of the evening. I like to taste it slowly. Alcohol is like love. The first kiss is magic.\' Then he started talking about her. \'I feel sorry for Sylvia. She\'s so terrible, but I think I like her. One day, she\'ll need someone, and no one else will be there. And I\'ll probably make a mess of it.\' \'What\'s this about?\' I asked. \'She\'s scared. I don\'t know of what. Maybe her father. He\'s a cold man. He doesn\'t even like her. If she annoys him too much, something might happen to her.\' \'You\'re her husband,\' I pointed out. \'Officially. Nothing more.\' \'I couldn\'t listen to this. I stood up and dropped some money on the table. \'You talk too much, and it\'s always about you. See you later,\' I walked out. Ten minutes later I was sorry, but ten minutes later I was somewhere else. I didn\'t see him again for a month. When I did, it was early in the morning. The doorbell woke me up. He was standing there, looking like hell. And he had a gun in his hand. The gun wasn\'t pointed at me; he was just holding it. \'You\'re driving me to Tijuana to get a plane at ten-fifteen. I have a passport but I don\'t have transportation. I\'ll pay you five hundred dollars for the ride.\' I stood in the door and didn\'t move to let him in. \'How about five hundred dollars plus the gun?\' I asked. He looked at it and then dropped it in his pocket. \'Come on in,\' I said, and he came in and fell into a chair. \'I\'m in trouble,\' he said. \'It\'s going to be a beautiful day. Cool, too. Yeah, I guessed you were in trouble. Let\'s talk about it after coffee. I always need my morning coffee.\' He followed me into the kitchen. I poured him a big drink from a bottle off the shelf. He had to use two hands to get it to his mouth. \'Didn\'t sleep at all last night,\' he said weakly. I poured him another drink and he drank this one with one hand. When he finished it, the coffee was ready. I sat down across from him. Without warning, his head came down on the table and he was crying. He didn\'t seem to notice when I took the gun from his pocket. I smelled it. It hadn\'t been fired. He lifted his head and said \'I didn\'t shoot anybody.\' I held up my hand. \'Wait a minute. It\'s like this. Be very careful what you tell me if you want me to help you. I can\'t be told about a crime you\'ve committed, or a crime you know has been committed. Not if you want me to drive you to Tijuana.\' He looked straight at me for the first time since he had come in. \'I said I was in trouble.\' \'I heard you. I don\'t want to know what kind of trouble. It\'s a matter of law. I can\'t know.\' \'I could make you drive me. With the gun,\' he said. I grinned and pushed the gun across the table. He didn\'t touch it. \'I\'m a man who sometimes has business with guns. I\'d look stupid trying to tell the police I was so scared I had to do what you told me to.\' \'Listen,\' he said, \'they won\'t even look in the bedroom until midday. She won\'t be there. The bed will be too neat, so they\'ll look in the guest house. Servants always know what goes on.\' \'And when they see her,\' I said, \'they\'ll think she\'s drunk, right? And that\'s the end of the story. That\'s all I want to hear. You\'re sick of it all; you\'ve been thinking of leaving for some time.\' \'I called her father last night,\' Lennox said, remembering. \'I told him I was leaving.\' \'What did he say?\' \'He was sorry. He wished me luck. Oh yes, he also asked me if I needed money. That\'s all he ever thinks about.\' \'Did you ever see her with a man in the guest house?\' I asked suddenly. He looked surprised. \'I never even tried.\' \'OK, so this is how it is. You came to me this morning and wanted a ride to Tijuana. You couldn\'t bear life with her anymore. Where you went was none of my business. We are friends and I did what you asked me.\' \'How does it sound?\' He looked at me hopefully. \'Depends on who\'s listening.\' \'I\'m sorry,\' he said. \'Your type\'s always sorry, and always too late. I\'ve still got that suitcase of yours. You need luggage. It\'ll look better.\' I got it from where I\'d kept it and put some things in it. Nothing used, nothing marked. Then I got the car out, locked up, and we left. We didn\'t have much to say to each other on the way down. The border people had nothing to say to us either. When we reached the airport, the plane was there but no one was hurrying. Terry went to get his ticket and came back. There were only a few people waiting with us. \'OK. I\'m ready,\' he said. \'This is where I say goodbye.\' We shook hands. He looked tired, very tired. \'I owe you,\' he said, \'but you don\'t owe me. We had a few drinks together and I talked too much about me. I left a five-hundred-dollar bill in your coffee jar.\' \'I wish you hadn\'t.\' \'I\'ll never spend half of what I have.\' \'Good luck, Terry. Go, get on the plane. I know you didn\'t kill her.\' He stared at me. He turned away, then looked back. \'I\'m sorry,\' he said quietly, \'you\'re wrong about that. I\'m going to walk slowly to the plane. You have plenty of time to stop me.\' He walked. I watched him. He went through a door. He was outside now. He stopped there and looked towards me. He didn\'t wave. Neither did I. Then he went up the steps into the aircraft. The engines started and that big silver bird began to roll away. The dust rose in clouds behind it. I watched it lift slowly into the air and disappear into the blue sky, going south. Then I left.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30914, 11701),
(30917, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 3 Simple Justice It was two in the afternoon when I got home and they were waiting for me. \'You Marlowe? We want to talk to you.\' This one was grey-blond and looked hard. His partner was tall, handsome and just looked nasty. They both had watching-and-waiting eyes. They showed me their badges. \'Sergeant Green, Central Homicide. This is Detective Dayton.\' I went on up and unlocked the door. You don\'t shake hands with the police. They sat in the living room and Green did the talking. \'Man named Terry Lennox. You know him, right?\' \'We have a drink together once in a while. He lives in Encino, married money. I\'ve never been there.\' I filled my pipe. \'This is where I ask you what it\'s all about and you tell me that you ask the questions, right?\' \'That\'s right. So you just answer them.\' I don\'t know, I guess I was tired. Maybe I felt a little guilty. \'I don\'t have to say anything.\' Dayton spoke up. \'Answer the questions, Marlowe. Just co-operate. It\'s healthier.\' Right away I didn\'t like him. His voice was a hard don\'t- fool-with-me voice. I went to the book shelf and took down the big state law book. I held it out to him. \'Find me the part that says I have to answer your questions. There\'s no such law.\' \'Sit down,\' Green said impatiently. \'Lennox\'s wife has been murdered. Ugly job. Murderer used something blunt. Must have hit her more than a dozen times. Husband is missing. We find your telephone number in his desk, marked with today\'s date. She\'d been seeing other men. We found that out, too.\' \'Terry Lennox wouldn\'t do anything like that. He\'s known about the other men for a long time.\' \'He\'s not going to tell us anything, Sergeant,\' Dayton said. \'He\'s read that law book. He thinks the law lives in the book. Don\'t you, Marlowe?\' I said nothing. I wasn\'t going to help him. \'Stand up,\' he said. I started to get up. I was half way up when he hit me. I sat back down and shook my head. Dayton was smiling; Green was looking away. \'Let\'s try again,\' Dayton suggested. I didn\'t move or speak. If I stood up, he\'d hit me again. But if he hit me again, I\'d hurt him. He couldn\'t hit me hard enough to stop me from hurting him next time. \'That was stupid,\' Green said to Dayton. \'That\'s just what he wanted. A good reason for not talking.\' I nodded. \'Terry Lennox is my friend. Maybe you have enough evidence. In court, I\'ll answer questions. But not here. Not now. You\'re not a bad guy, Green. Your partner has psychological problems, that\'s all. And if he hits me again, he\'ll have medical problems, too.\' They had no choice. They put the bracelets on me and took me in. *** At the station, I still didn\'t feel like talking. But now the person I wasn\'t talking to was a captain. \'Thinks he\'s tough,\' the Captain said. \'We could change that.\' He didn\'t sound as if he really cared. \'Guess we\'d better. You can talk now.\' I didn\'t say anything. He reached for the coffee cup on his desk. I was in a chair facing him. The bracelets were on tight. That\'s the way he wanted them. But when he threw the coffee at me, I was faster than he was. Most of it missed. \'Doesn\'t like coffee. Look, pal, you\'ve got some information that I want. Saying nothing at all is no good.\' \'If I tell you what you want,\' I asked, \'will you take the bracelets off?\' \'Maybe, maybe not. Tell me first.\' \'If I say I haven\'t seen Lennox today, would that satisfy you?\' \'It might.\' But he was losing patience. \'If I believed you.\' \'I\'d like to talk to a lawyer. How about that?\' The Captain laughed. It was a short, ugly laugh. He leaned across the desk and hit me with a hand of stone. There was thunder inside my head. When he spoke to me again, the words seemed to come from far away. \'I used to be tough but I\'m getting old. You take a good blow, Marlowe, and that\'s all you\'ll get from me. We have younger, stronger guys for this work. OK, you won\'t talk to me but you\'ll talk to them. I promise you that.\' The telephone rang. Green handed it to the Captain. \'Yes, sir,\' the Captain said, \'he\'s here. Really? Is that an order?\' His face was red and getting redder. \'Fine, sir.\' He put the telephone down with a bang. He was shaking with anger when he turned to speak to me. \'The DA wants you for himself. You\'re his headache now.\' He told Green to get me out of there. Before we reached the door, however, one of those stone hands and we stopped. \'You\'ve got something to say, right? Your type always does. Say it.\' \'Yes, sir,\' I answered him politely. \'You probably didn\'t intend to, but you\'ve done me a favour. You\'ve solved a problem for me. No man likes to betray a friend but I wouldn\'t even betray an enemy to you. I might have told you something before you hit me; now I wouldn\'t tell you what day of the week it is.\' Green marched me out. I spent the next three days in jail. It wasn\'t so bad. It was quiet and it was clean. No one bothered me. On the third day, a guard unlocked my door in the middle of the morning. \'Your lawyer is here. And don\'t throw that cigarette on the floor.\' He took me to the conference room. A tall man with dark hair was standing there looking out of the window. He turned and waited for the door to close. He took out a fancy cigarette case and looked me over. \'Sit down, Marlowe. Cigarette? My name is Endicott. Sewell Endicott. I\'ve been told to help you. It won\'t cost you anything. I guess you\'d like to get out of here.\' I sat down and took one of his cigarettes. He lit it for me. I asked him who had sent him. He wouldn\'t tell me. \'I guess that means they caught him.\' He shook his head. \'If you mean Lennox, and of course you do, no, they haven\'t caught him.\' \'If they haven\'t got Terry, why are they holding me?\' He frowned. \'I think I can help you get out of here, so let\'s work on your problems and not Terry\'s. Don\'t you want my help?\' No, I told him, I didn\'t. When a clever lawyer gets you out of jail before the police are ready to let you go, people talk. They say unkind things. \'Listen,\' I said, \'I\'m not in here for Lennox. I\'m in here for me. I\'m in a business where people come to me with troubles. Troubles they don\'t want to share with the police. That\'s why I\'m not talking. You can tell Terry that.\' \'I see your point,\' Endicott said, \'but I have to tell you, I\'m not in contact with Lennox. If I knew where he was, I\'d have to tell the police. I\'m a lawyer, and that\'s the law.\' \'You believe in the law?\' The question annoyed him. \'The law,\' he said, \'is not justice. It\'s just a half-broken machine. If you push the right buttons and you\'re lucky at the same time, you might get some justice. Now, do you want my help or not?\' I still didn\'t. \'I\'ll wait a few more days. If they catch Terry, they won\'t care how he got away. And if they don\'t get him, they\'ll want to forget it all fast. By the way, why haven\'t any reporters been in to see me? I thought the old man, Harlan Potter, owned nine or ten newspapers. With all that money and power, he should be able to make this into a real party.\' Endicott looked at me coldly. \'You\'re strange, Marlowe. You know so little. All that money and power can also buy a lot of silence.\' He opened the door and went out. The guard took me back and locked me in again. I had said I would wait a few days, but it turned out I didn\'t have to. A few hours later, another guard came and took me to see someone in the DA\'s office. We went through the door without knocking. A fat man with a square chin and stupid eyes was pushing something into the drawer of his desk. The guard left, and I pulled a chair over and sat down. \'I didn\'t say you could sit down,\' the man said sharply. I took out a cigarette. \'And I didn\'t say you could smoke,\' he shouted at me. I lit my cigarette. \'Take another drink from that bottle in the desk,\' I said. \'It\'ll make you feel better.\' He waited a minute. Then he said, \'A tough guy, huh? Some hard guys come in here, but that\'s not the way they leave. They leave here small. I want a full statement from you.\' \'I get so tired of it,\' I said, looking into those stupid eyes. \'Tired of what?\' \'Hard little men in hard little offices talking hard little words that don\'t mean a thing. You think a few days in here is going to make me cry on your shoulder? Forget it. And forget the threats. If you\'re big enough, you don\'t need them, and if you need them, you\'re not big enough to scare me.\' The fat man played with some papers on his desk. Then he looked up, smiling. \'It doesn\'t really matter if you don\'t talk. We\'ve found your friend.\' I didn\'t believe him, and I let him know it. \'Believe me. Believe me, too, that we have people that saw you with him at Tijuana Airport. You want the whole story? Lennox got off the plane in Mazatlan. He disappeared for about an hour. Then a tall man with black hair and dark skin and a scar, maybe a knife scar, booked to Torreon under the name of Silvano Rodriguez. He was too tall to be so dark. The pilot turned in a report on him. The police were too slow in Torreon but they followed him to a little mountain town called Otatoclan. He rented a hotel room there. He was wearing a gun, too, but that\'s not unusual in Mexico. But the police were right behind him, see? They found him in the hotel.\' I laughed. \'That\'s a terrible story. Lennox is too smart to try to be a Mexican in Mexico. You don\'t know where he is. That\'s why you want my statement.\' He took the bottle out then and had a drink. Then he picked up one of the papers from his desk, grabbed a pen, and signed it. \'I\'ve just set you free. Want to know why?\' I stood up. \'If you want to tell me.\' \'The investigation\'s finished. Lennox finished it. He wrote a full confession this afternoon in his hotel room in Otatoclan. Then he shot himself.\' I stood there looking at nothing. The fat man watched me nervously. I think he thought I might hit him. I didn\'t. I just walked out and closed the door. I closed it quietly as if on a room where someone had just died. *** I met a friend downstairs on my way out. He wanted to know why I was there, so I told him. Morgan is a reporter, and he gave me a ride home because he is my friend and because he is a reporter. \'Very neat, don\'t you think?\' he asked, after he had listened to my story. \'You think this isn\'t straight?\' \'Two things. Harlan Potter is a very rich man who hates having his name in any newspaper, even his own newspapers. So the trial would have annoyed him. Now Lennox is dead and there\'s not going to be a trial. Convenient for Potter.\' He continued after a minute. \'Then, there\'s a chance that the poor fool had a little help shooting himself.\' I didn\'t think he had needed help. He hadn\'t thought much of himself lately. But maybe Morgan wasn\'t all wrong. Before he dropped me off, he had one more thing to suggest. \'If I were a clever reporter instead of a stupid one, I\'d think maybe he didn\'t kill her at all.\' It was something to think about, but I was too tired to think. I went in and made some coffee, drank it and took Terry\'s five-hundred-dollar bill out of the coffee jar. I brought in the newspapers that were on the front steps and read about Lennox. There was even a short story about me. One thing bothered me, though ? the way she\'d been killed. I was still sure Terry couldn\'t have done that. But no one was going to explain it to me, because no explanation was necessary now. The murderer had confessed and he was dead. It was good work either way. If he had killed her, it was simple justice. If he hadn\'t, that was fine, too. He couldn\'t deny it now.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30916, 11701),
(30919, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 4 Letter from a Dead Man The next morning, I was back at the office, business as usual. When I thought about Terry, I tried not to let it hurt, but I still felt I owned a little piece of him, so it did. The bell and the telephone rang at the same time. I answered the telephone first. \'Mr Marlowe? This is Sewell Endicott.\' \'Good morning, Mr Endicott.\' \'Glad to hear you\'re free. I guess it\'s over, but if they bother you again about this, call me.\' \'The man\'s dead,\' I said. \'They won\'t bother me again. They have their confession.\' \'Yes, I know,\' he said. \'I\'m flying to Mexico today to look at the body for them. But let me give you some advice before I go. Don\'t be too certain they won\'t make trouble for you. Private detectives aren\'t their favourite people. And stubborn private detectives, well. . .\' He hung up without finishing the sentence. I opened my office door. The man had let himself into the waiting room. He was sitting by the window, reading a magazine. He looked quite comfortable. He had thick, dark hair and was very brown from the sun. His clothes probably cost more than I earned in a couple of months. He threw the magazine onto the low table. \'The stuff they write these days.\' \'What can I do for you?\' He looked at me for a moment and then laughed. \'A hero on a bicycle.\' \'What?\' \'You, Marlowe. A hero on a bicycle. Did they hurt you much?\' \'Why do you care?\' He didn\'t answer. Instead he stood up and walked into my office. I followed him. \'You\'re a little man. Look at this place. You don\'t make much money, do you? A cheap little man.\' I let him talk and sat down behind my desk. \'That\'s it. You\'re a cheap guy. Cheap feelings. Have a few drinks with somebody and suddenly you\'re his pal. You have nothing. A hero on a bicycle.\' He leaned over the desk and slapped me. It didn\'t hurt, and I didn\'t move. \'You know who I am, Cheapie?\' \'Your name is Menendez. They call you Mendy.\' \'Yeah, that\'s right.\' He took a gold cigarette case out of his pocket and lit a brown cigarette with a gold lighter. \'I\'m a big bad man, Marlowe. I make a lot of money. I have to make a lot of money, so I can pay the men I have to pay so I can make a lot of money. I have a house in Bel Air that cost ninety thousand and that was before I fixed it up. I\'ve got a beautiful wife and my children go to private schools. My wife likes diamonds. I\'ve got six servants. Five cars. What do you have, Marlowe?\' \'Why don\'t you tell me what you want?\' He put out his cigarette and lit another. \'Let me tell you a story. In the war, there were three guys in a hole. It was cold, very cold. It was snowing. Randy Starr, Terry Lennox and me. Something lands right in the hole but it doesn\'t explode. The Germans had a lot of tricks. Sometimes you think it won\'t explode and then three seconds later you\'re wrong. Anyway, Terry grabbed this one and jumped out of the hole. He was quick. Very quick. He threw it and it exploded in the air. A piece got him on the side of the face. Right then, the Germans attacked and we had to run. We left him; we thought he was dead. The Germans found him and had him for a year and a half. They did a good job on his face but they hurt him too much. That\'s why his hair was white. \'Randy and I spent money to find him. He\'d saved our lives. All he got from his share was half of a new face. And then, when he\'s really in trouble, he doesn\'t come to us. He comes to you, Cheapie. That makes us mad, see? I could\'ve helped him. Instead he\'s dead, and you think you\'re a hero.\' I shook my head. \'No, I don\'t.\' \'Of course you do. The story is over, Marlowe. Even if-\' he stopped in the middle of the sentence. \'Even if Terry didn\'t kill her,\' I said. \'If that\'s the way Terry wanted it, then that\'s how it stays. See you around, Cheapie.\' I felt old and tired. I got up slowly and picked up his cigarette case from my desk. \'You forgot this,\' I said, going towards him. \'So what? I\'ve got a dozen,\' he said. He didn\'t even reach for it. \'How about a dozen of these?\' I asked, moving in fast and close, and hitting him as hard as I could in the stomach. He fell back against the wall making the sounds a cat makes when it\'s sick. Then, very slowly, he straightened up. I patted his cheek gently. He didn\'t push my hand away. \'I didn\'t think you had the courage,\' he said weakly. \'Next time bring a gun.\' \'I got a guy to carry the gun,\' he said. \'Maybe you\'ll meet him one of these days.\' He walked out slowly. *** After that, nothing happened for three days. Sylvia Lennox was buried. The press was not invited to the funeral, and her father, as usual, gave no public statement. In the afternoon of the third day, the telephone rang and I found myself talking to a man named Howard Spencer, a New York publisher who said he had a California problem. We agreed to meet in the bar of his hotel the next morning. I needed the job because I needed the money ? or thought I did, until I got home and found a letter. The envelope was covered with Mexican stamps. I recognized the handwriting in the address. I was holding a letter from a dead man. I opened it and read. It didn\'t start with my name; it just started. I\'m sitting in a hotel room in a town called Otatoclan. There\'s a mailbox just below the window and when the boy comes with the coffee I ordered, he is going to mail this letter for me. I\'m going to watch him put it in the box, and then I\'ll pay him. I can\'t mail it myself because I can\'t leave my room. They\'re outside, waiting for me. I want you to have this money because I don\'t need it and the police would steal it if I kept it. Maybe you think I didn\'t kill her. It doesn\'t matter, though. Her father and her sister were always good to me. A trial would hurt them. I don\'t want that. I don\'t care what happens to me. I\'m disgusted with my life. I\'ve written a confession. You read about this in books, but you don\'t read the truth. The truth is, I feel sick and very scared. But I\'m going to do it anyway. So forget it and me. But first drink a gin and lime for me at Victor\'s. After that, forget the whole thing. Goodbye. That was all. That and a five-thousand-dollar bill. I looked at it carefully. I had never seen one before. Lots of people who work in banks haven\'t, either. Menendez probably had a dozen. *** I met Mr Howard Spencer at eleven the next morning. I was early and he was late. While I was waiting, I looked at the people who come to a hotel bar at eleven in the morning. There were two young men with a telephone at their table. They took turns making calls and shouting at each other and at the people they called. There was a man sitting at the bar who was telling the story of his life to no one in particular, a long, sad story. I had almost become tired of waiting when a dream in a white skirt walked in. There are blondes, and blondes. Different kinds. I know; I\'ve studied the subject. There are blondes who read big, long books and write poetry. There are blondes who like parties and laugh loudly at all the jokes, even the old ones. There are blondes, too, who marry millionaires and live on the south coast of France and kiss their husbands good-night downstairs. But this one was not any of these kinds. She was unique. She was quite tall, and had eyes like a summer sky. She smiled gently at the old waiter who pulled out a chair for her. I just held my breath and watched. I was still watching when a man\'s voice said, close to my shoulder, \'I must apologize for being so late, Mr Marlowe. I\'m Howard Spencer.\' I had trouble tearing my eyes away from the dream to look at him. He was about forty-five years old, wearing a suit that was fine for Boston but all wrong for California. He was carrying an old leather case. \'Two new books in here,\' he said, patting the leather. \'I\'m sure they are awful. But I don\'t suppose you care about publishers\' problems.\' \'I could,\' I said, \'if it has anything to do with the job.\' I admired the way Spencer was looking right at me, not giving any attention to the blonde. He ordered drinks and explained the job. One of his authors lived out here, a man named Roger Wade. I knew the name but hadn\'t read the books. Apparently everyone else did, though, because Wade was one of Spencer\'s biggest writers. Except that Wade had been having a bad period lately. He drank too much, Spencer said, and went a little crazy sometimes. He had hurt his wife. More important to Spencer, however, he had also stopped writing. All that Spencer wanted was for me to save the wife from the writer, the writer from himself, and a half-finished book from the bottle in Wade\'s desk. That\'s all. It was interesting. It was also impossible. I told him that what he needed was a male nurse, not a detective. I couldn\'t stop a man from drinking, and if the wife was living with him, I couldn\'t protect her, either. Not day and night. \'Your answer is no, then?\' \'I\'m sorry, Mr Spencer. I don\'t think I\'d be able to help.\' Suddenly, a voice that was not Spencer\'s said, \'You\'re wrong, Mr Marlowe. I\'m sure you could help.\' It was a voice like honey. I looked up into a pair of violet eyes. \'He doesn\'t want to help, Eileen,\' Spencer said. She smiled. \'I disagree.\' I stopped staring long enough to answer. \'I didn\'t say I wasn\'t interested, Mrs Wade. I just don\'t think it would work. I\'m sorry.\' I thought she would argue but she didn\'t. She gave me her card in case I changed my mind, thanked me, and left. Just like that. I sat down, grabbed my whisky, and watched her walk out of the hotel. What a walk! When she had gone, Spencer turned to me, something new in his eyes. \'Nice,\' I said, \'but you should\'ve looked at her once or twice while we talked. She\'s much too pretty to ignore.\' Spencer went red in the face. \'She\'s married, Mr Marlowe.\' I smiled. \'That doesn\'t make her ugly, Mr Spencer.\' We did not shake hands when he left. *** That night I received a telephone call from Green. \'Thought you might want to know. They buried Lennox down in Mexico today. Some lawyer took care of it.\' Endicott, I thought. \'Thanks for telling me, Sergeant. Anything else?\' \'Just this. Lennox is buried and so is the rest of it. Leave it alone.\' Sweet dreams to you, too, I thought.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30918, 11701),
(30921, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 5 Dr Verringer\'s Farm Next morning, the bell rang just as I finished shaving. I opened the door and looked into a pair of violet eyes again. She was wearing a brown suit this time. \'Come in, Mrs Wade. Like a cup of coffee?\' She came into the living room and sat down. \'Thank you. Black coffee, please.\' I brought the coffee in my good cups. They were the only two in the kitchen that matched. \'The last time I had coffee with someone was just before I went to jail,\' I said. \'I guess you knew I\'d been to jail, Mrs Wade.\' She nodded. \'They thought you helped him escape, didn\'t they? He must have been insane.\' I filled a pipe and lit it. \'Yes, he must have been. He was badly hurt in the war. But I don\'t think you came here to talk about that.\' It took a little more conversation and another cup of coffee to find out what the problem was. Roger Wade was missing. Spencer hadn\'t told me because Spencer didn\'t know. This was Mrs Wade\'s little secret. Apparently, Wade did this often. But this time his wife was worried. Something was wrong, she said. \'Mr Spencer said the same thing, Mrs Wade. He thought it might be some hidden guilt that makes your husband drink so much. What do you think?\' She said she didn\'t know. She added that if Wade had a secret, even a bad secret, something criminal, for instance, she wouldn\'t care. She just wanted him back. \'Let\'s say I say yes this time,\' I asked her, \'where would I start? Do you have any idea where he is?\' \'Yes and no,\' she replied after thinking. \'He\'s at some doctor\'s place, I\'m sure. He goes to them when he\'s been drinking heavily, and they help him stop. For a few days, at least. But I don\'t know these doctors.\' She did, however, have a note she found in her husband\'s desk. He had written \'I do not like you, Doctor V, but right now you\'re the man for me.\' We had finished all the coffee. \'Please,\' she begged, \'find Roger and bring him home.\' How could I refuse a lady like that twice? I couldn\'t. I said I would try and she thanked me and left. No matter how clever you think you are, you have to have a place to start from; a name, an address, something. All I had was the letter V. So I did what I do when I need help; I called a friend and asked. George Peters worked for a big detective agency but he hadn\'t forgotten the old hard times. Sure, he said, he could give me ten minutes if I came to his office. He hadn\'t changed much with the years. He was still thin, he was still all smiles, and he was still a busy man. \'What can I do for you?\' he asked from behind a desk like a football field. \'I\'d like to see your file on the doctors in the hotel business. You know, the ones where you go when no one knows where you are. I\'ve got a missing man who\'s probably trying to stop drinking. He\'s rich and his wife is worried.\' Peters found the file and we looked at it together. There were three names and addresses under the letter V. I copied them down. \'Thanks, pal. I\'ll do the same for you one day.\' \'Forget it,\' Peters said. \'By the way, I heard something about your friend Lennox that might interest you. One of our men knew a guy in New York five or six years ago. He\'s certain it was Lennox, except his name wasn\'t Lennox then. It was Marston. Of course, he could be wrong.\' I said I doubted it was the same man. \'Our man thinks it was. He\'s in Seattle now, but I can have him call you when he returns, if you want.\' \'Sure. Why not?\' And I left to check on the doctors. If you are an honest doctor in California, you might get rich or you might get poor; if you are a dishonest doctor, you are going to make money. I had three names: Varley, a bone doctor; Vukanich, ear, nose and throat; and Verringer, who called himself Doctor but didn\'t say of what. I started with Vukanich, an unpleasant character who pretended not to understand that I wanted more than an examination. He did not seem to be my man anyway. He had nothing more than a small office. Not fancy enough. Varley was in another class. He ran a private hospital and was very friendly. He smiled when he said he couldn\'t help me, and he smiled as he asked me why I was looking for Wade here. I explained that the hospital was on a list of places where certain things had happened in the past, things involving the police. Dr Varley became suddenly less friendly. We ended our conversation there, but I had already seen enough of Varley\'s hospital. He took care of the old and the weak. He wasn\'t tough enough to handle real trouble. I crossed him off, too, and went to find Dr Verringer. His place was out in the hills. I liked that, and not just because the air was cleaner there. I liked a place where people wouldn\'t bother to look for a man. I got there just as it was getting dark. Verringer had a farm, with a circle of small buildings surrounding the main house. This time I decided not to be polite. I drove past the front gate, parked off the road and came back on foot. I climbed the fence behind the farm and went slowly towards the lights of the buildings. It was dark and I had a pocket torch but I didn\'t want to use it. I was carrying a gun, too, and I didn\'t want to have to use that either. I stopped at the edge of an empty swimming-pool. I heard a door open so I hid. A light went on outside the main house, a single bright light that made a circle in the dirt between the buildings. Into this circle stepped a cowboy, dressed like a movie cowboy, with an enormous hat, a pair of silver guns at his side, and a rope that he swung over his head. He played with the rope for a few minutes and then practised taking his guns out of his gunbelt as quickly as he could. He was fast. He was also obviously a little crazy. When he\'d finished his game, whatever it was, he went back into the house. The light went out as he went in. There was another, smaller light on in one of the buildings far from the big house. I walked over, moving as quietly as possible. I didn\'t want to be in the cowboy\'s movie tonight, because his guns just might have been loaded. I reached a window of the hut. It was now dark enough to look in without being seen. There was one man on a bed and another on a chair. They were talking. The man on the bed was angry but he was so weak that his shout was no louder than a whisper. The other man was speaking calmly and patiently. The man on the bed said, \'I already paid you and I paid you well. You got six hundred dollars. And that was too much.\' The man in the chair didn\'t disagree. He only said, \'You called me, remember? I came to you in your hour of need. I told you it would be expensive. You insisted. I want another five thousand dollars, Wade.\' \'I was drunk,\' Wade said. \'I would\'ve promised you anything.\' You\'ll write me a cheque, my friend. Now, at once. Then you\'ll get dressed and Earl will take you home.\' Wade laughed. \'A cheque? Sure, I\'ll give you a cheque.\' The doctor smiled. \'You think you can call the bank later and tell them not to accept it. But you won\'t. Earl will drive you home.\' \'No, thanks. That boy\'s insane. Crazier every time I see him.\' Verringer shook his head. \'Earl isn\'t normal, I know, but I have ways of handling him.\' \'That\'s what you think,\' a new voice said, and Earl came through the door in his pretty cowboy suit. \'Keep that monkey away from me,\' Wade shouted, and this time it was not a whisper. Earl didn\'t like the description. He started for Wade. Verringer jumped between them and was pushed roughly aside by the cowboy. I ran for the door and came into the room with my gun out. Earl spun around, forgetting Wade. The doctor was picking himself up off the floor. The cowboy came right at me. He didn\'t touch his guns and he didn\'t seem to see mine. I fired through the open window over the bed. Earl stopped, looked at the hole in the window screen, and looked back at me, smiling. \'That\'s a real gun, isn\'t it? Oh, boy.\' \'Take the gunbelt off. Slowly.\' Earl kept his smile. \'OK. Only these aren\'t real guns, you know.\' He took the belt off and put it down. Wade grabbed a gun. \'He\'s right. They\'re toys.\' Earl gave Wade a dirty look but then he noticed the doctor, who was leaning against the wall, rubbing his head. \'Sorry,\' Earl said in a small voice. The doctor patted Earl gently on the shoulder and smiled. I pulled Wade out of there while I had the chance. Verringer watched us leave and said nothing until we were almost too far to hear him, and then he called out. \'You promised me, Wade. Five thousand.\' I put Wade in my car and we started for home. His home first. He wanted to talk. I couldn\'t stop him. \'You were great back there. Who are you?\' I told him. I explained that his wife had hired me. \'Whatever she\'s paying you, it isn\'t enough.\' \'She isn\'t paying me, Mr Wade,\' I told him, \'you are. I\'d like the money from you. Seems better that way.\' Wade agreed. Then his thoughts turned to the doctor. \'You think I should pay him the five thousand? He took good care of me. He\'s not a bad guy. Tries to keep Earl from killing himself, from killing everybody else. Don\'t know why he bothers. He let his business go to hell because of that crazy boy. I don\'t understand that. And I\'m the big writer, supposed to understand people. Should I give him the money?\' I told him I didn\'t have an opinion either way. \'You don\'t like me, do you, Marlowe? Wait a minute. Marlowe. I know you. You were mixed up with Lennox, weren\'t you?\' I said I had been. Wade nodded. He knew them, he said, Terry and Sylvia. He knew her better than he knew him, he said. He asked me questions I didn\'t want to answer. He was just a job and that\'s what I told him. When we reached his house, he went straight in. I was going to drive off but she came out. To thank me. \'You found him. I knew you would. Come in and have a drink,\' she offered. \'Some other time.\' I lit a cigarette and she smoked a little of it. \'You knew Sylvia Lennox,\' I said. \'Why didn\'t you tell me?\' She looked surprised. \'The woman that was murdered? I didn\'t know her personally. I knew the name, that\'s all. I should go in, Mr Marlowe, and see if my husband needs anything.\' \'I need something, too,\' I said, and I pulled her to me and kissed her. She didn\'t help me and she didn\'t fight me. She just let me do the whole job myself. \'You shouldn\'t have,\' she said when I released her. \'But still, thanks for the other work you\'ve done.\' And she walked away and went into her nice house without stopping at the door to wave. I waved, though. I waved at the closed door and then I went home, too.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30920, 11701);

(30923, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 6 Empty Like a Glass The next day was just another day at the office. A giant came in and told me someone was trying to poison his dog. He suspected the lady next door. He wasn\'t happy when I told him I couldn\'t help, but at least he didn\'t hit me with my desk. A woman with a face like a sad story came in because she thought the girl she lived with was robbing her. She wanted me to come over and scare the girl. She left as disappointed as the giant. Then a man came in with the oldest story in the book; a young wife who had taken the money and run. He didn\'t want the money. He wanted his wife back. I could help him, and I did. It was easy enough. I didn\'t get rich on it, but why should I care? I was a man with a five-thousand-dollar piece of government paper in my pocket. Three days later, Eileen Wade called to invite me over for drinks the next evening. Foolish curiosity made me say yes. Foolish curiosity also made me re-read Terry Lennox\'s letter after I hung up. It reminded me that I hadn\'t had the gin and lime at Victor\'s he\'d asked me to have. The bar was almost empty when I got there. Terry would have been pleased. I was surprised to hear the woman in front of me order the same drink. She wasn\'t English, either. I might have found out more about her if I hadn\'t noticed I was being watched. I approached the man straight on. \'You\'re watching me. If I sit here next to you, it will make your job easier.\' \'Sure, pal, sit where you want.\' \'You\' re one of Mendy\'s boys, right? A little guy with no name.\' He didn\'t like the conversation. \'I got a name. And I\'m not one of the boys, I\'m his number one. More than you can say, Marlowe.\' \'You\'re supposed to watch me. OK, watch me leave.\' I paid for the drink and went out the door. The boy came out right behind me. There might have been trouble if this enormous man hadn\'t got out of an enormous car and picked the boy up with one huge hand. \'I keep telling you cheap gangsters. Stay away from my favourite places. You spoil my appetite.\' The giant threw my watcher against the outer wall of the bar with the one arm that had been holding him, and Mendy\'s number one boy hit it hard and stayed there until the giant disappeared into Victor\'s. \'What was that?\' I asked as the boy found his feet. \'Big Willie Magoon. A policeman. He thinks he\'s tough.\' \'You mean he isn\'t sure?\' I asked him politely. The boy ignored me and limped away into the Hollywood night. When I reached the Wade house the next afternoon, the party had already begun. I parked my old car between two new expensive ones and walked in. A Mexican in a white coat opened the door for me, liked my name, and let me in. It was the same party everybody has. People were talking too loud and not listening at all. Everyone had a glass in his hand, and the glasses were all half-empty. Eileen Wade came up and said she was very glad I could come. Her husband wanted to see me, she added. He hadn\'t joined the party because he hated parties. He was in his study, she said. The Mexican took me to see him. He also warned me that Senor Wade was very busy. Wade was busy lying on a sofa. There was a pile of уеllow paper next to the typewriter on his desk. The Mexican left and Wade sat up. \'Good of you to come, Marlowe. Did you have a drink or two?\' I said no and asked him how his work was going. \'Fine. It just comes out. That\'s how it is when it\'s good. If it\'s hard work, it\'s bad writing.\' He said this almost angrily so I was kind enough to disagree. \'It was hard for Flaubert, and his stuff\'s good.\' \'Oh, God, an intellectual detective. Well, I hate intellectuals. I\'m not drinking and I hate everyone. I hate you, too.\' \'I understand,\' I said. \'You need somebody to insult. Go ahead. When it begins to hurt, I\'ll let you know.\' Wade laughed. \'I hate myself, too. And my terrible books that sell and sell. So how can you help me?\' \'Maybe I don\'t want to help,\' I said. \'Let\'s have a drink. Because I like you.\' He was laughing again. \'Not in here, pal. Not you and me alone. I don\'t want to have to watch you take the first one.\' \'You know, Marlowe, I think you could help. Why don\'t you come and live here and keep me safe from harm and tell me all about Flaubert?\' I shook my head. \'I couldn\'t stop you.\' \'Try it. I could finish the miserable book. I have to finish it. If I can\'t finish things I start, I might as well be dead.\' I didn\'t want to listen to this kind of nonsense. \'You did as much for Lennox,\' he said suddenly. I walked right up to him and gave him a hard stare. \'I got Lennox killed. That\'s what I did for Terry.\' Wade said I was talking like a fool. He cursed at me but without much feeling. I couldn\'t really help anyway, he said, telling me what I already knew. It was something personal, he said. \'About your wife?\' \'I don\'t think so. I think it\'s about me. Forget it, though. Let\'s go out and have that drink and see all those nice people who do want to watch me have that first one.\' The party was louder than before. Wade said hello here and there and then headed for the bar. As Candy, the Mexican, mixed our drinks, I saw a face I knew. It was the woman from Victor\'s, the one who had ordered the gin and lime. Wade gave her a real smile. \'Hello, Linda. This is Philip Marlowe. Marlowe, this is Linda Loring. You have something in common.\' If she recognized me from the night before, she didn\'t show it. She extended her hand. \'Hello, Mr Marlowe. What Roger won\'t say is that I\'m Sylvia Lennox\'s sister. And I know who you are.\' Her hand was cool and she didn\'t let me keep it for long. As she took it back, a thin man with a neat beard and a very white face came up to us. He ignored me and gave Wade an ugly look. Linda Loring said \'My husband, Mr Marlowe.\' He didn\'t even look at me. He was giving all his poisonous attention to Wade. \'I have something to say to you, Wade. Stay away from my wife.\' Wade seemed amused. \'You\'re my guest today, Dr Loring, so all I\'ll say is that I think you\'ve misunderstood something.\' Loring found a glove in one of his pockets and slapped Wade across the face with it. The writer didn\'t move a muscle. \'Very dramatic, Doctor. Next time, why don\'t you do it when I have a chance to answer the challenge? It would be more interesting. Right now, I think you\'re looking for the door. Candy will show it to you.\' Wade turned back to the bar. \'Candy, the doctor is leaving.\' Loring grabbed for his wife\'s hand, but she was too quick. \'I\'m not leaving,\' she said. \'You are.\' Loring raised the glove again but Wade stepped between the husband and wife. \'We don\'t do that here, Doctor.\' \'Don\'t we?\' Loring asked sarcastically, but he put the glove away and left. Candy shut the door behind him. I picked up my drink and looked around for Wade, but he had disappeared. No wonder he didn\'t like parties. I took a walk out to the terrace and settled into a soft chair facing the lake. A minute later, Eileen Wade was sitting next to me. She wanted to know if I had accepted Roger\'s offer to stay with them. I told her I hadn\'t. I said that if she wanted to help her husband, she should find him a good psychiatrist. She looked surprised. \'A psychiatrist? Why?\' \'I\'m not an expert, but I think your husband does have a secret, a secret he has buried so deep inside himself that he can\'t find it. Maybe something he did when he was drunk. So he drinks to find it. Unless he just drinks because he can\'t write anymore.\' She frowned. \'It\'s not that. Roger has a great amount of talent. His best book is still inside him.\' \'Then maybe it\'s something between the two of you.\' She answered immediately. \'No. I love my husband. Not the way a young girl loves, perhaps, but I do love him. A woman is only a young girl once. The man I loved then is dead. He died in the war. His initials, strangely enough, were the same as yours. They never even found his body. Sometimes I even think I see him. At a party or in a restaurant. It\'s silly, I know, but we were very much in love. That crazy love that doesn\'t happen twice.\' She wasn\'t looking at me anymore. She was staring at the lake. I looked back at the house and Wade was there in the doorway. I joined him. He had had more than that first drink. \'How\'s my wife, Marlowe? Did you give her another kiss?\' I said I was leaving. \'Go ahead. But I\'ll tell you what the doctor told me. Stay away from my wife, Marlowe. Because it isn\'t any good. She\'s not there, see? Empty, like a glass. Did she tell you about her old love? The one that died in Norway but they never found? Be careful, Marlowe. People do disappear.\' I walked away from him. As I passed the bar, Candy called to me. \'Senor, one drink left. You want it?\' I told him to drink it but he said he was a beer man. He said that\'s how the Spanish were. He said that he was very Spanish, and that he had the knife to prove it. He didn\'t need me to help him take care of his boss. \'You\'re doing such a good job, Candy. Who brought him home?\' I speak enough Spanish to know what he called me. He didn\'t hold the door for me when I left.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30922, 11701),
(30925, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 7 Pretty Necklace Around a Pretty Neck For a week, the Wades left me alone. I did what I do for a living. Then I got a call on a Thursday night from Wade. His voice was bad. He was breathing hard. \'I\'m in terrible shape, Marlowe. I\'m losing control. Can you come over quickly?\' I said I would, and then the telephone went dead. I shouted into it but there was no reply. I was in my car a minute later, and drove like a bullet through the streets and up into the hills where they lived. I imagined Wade throwing his wife down the stairs. I imagined him beating on her locked door. I drove even faster. When I got there, Eileen Wade was standing in the open front door in a pretty dress, nice and cool, smoking a cigarette. If there was any excitement around her, I\'d brought it with me. \'Where is he?\' \'He had a fall,\' she said calmly. \'He cut his head on something. There was only a little blood.\' \'That\'s nice,\' I said. \'Where is he now?\' She looked at me quietly and then she pointed out at the darkness towards the lake. \'Out there somewhere. You find him. I\'ve had enough.\' And she went into the house. He was right where she had pointed, lying on his stomach. The back of his head was sticky. I talked to him but he didn\'t answer. I tried to lift him, dropped him, tried again and got him across my back. He was as heavy as stone. I made it into the house and dropped him on the sofa. My back screamed as I straightened up. Mrs Wade came in and said she\'d called her doctor. He hadn\'t wanted to come, she said. This confused me until she explained that Loring was her doctor. He showed up fifteen minutes later, took a glance at Wade\'s cut, and said there was no danger. He put his hat back on and started to leave. \'I can\'t get him upstairs alone, Doctor,\' I said. \'Then leave him where he is,\' Loring said coldly. \'You might wash his head, too. He\'s not my patient.\' \'I\'m not asking you to treat him, Doctor. I\'m asking for some help in getting him to his bedroom,\' I said, beginning to get angry. \'And just who are you?\' he asked sharply. \'My name\'s Marlowe. We were introduced last week. All I want is. . .\' He interrupted me. \'I\'m not interested in what you want.\' He started for the door but I stepped in front of it. \'Just a minute. You\'re a doctor and this man needs help. I can\'t get him upstairs alone. What do you say?\' \'Get out of my way,\' he said through his teeth, \'or I shall call the police. I\'m a professional man, and as a professional. . .\' This time I interrupted him. \'As a professional man, you\'re a sack of dirt.\' I stepped out of his way. He went out like a storm. Perhaps he hadn\'t brought his glove this time. Instead, his eyes smacked me as he went through the door. In the end, Candy came home, and we carried Wade up the stairs together. The Mexican wanted to know what I was doing there. I didn\'t like his curiosity and told him so. He showed me his knife. Candy didn\'t like me. I couldn\'t understand why; I\'m very easy to like. He asked me if I had hit Wade. I told him his boss had fallen and that he wasn\'t hurt badly. The knife disappeared. We undressed Wade and put him to bed. Candy went to change. I washed the cut and Wade opened his eyes. \'What happened?\' \'I\'d say the usual. Except you also fell and cut your head this time. It\'s not serious. Why don\'t you get some sleep?\' \'Sleep,\' he said, \'what\'s that?\' \'Maybe a pill would help. Got any?\' He said there were some in the drawer. They were Mrs Wade\'s pills, and they were strong. Loring\'s name was on the plastic bottle. I gave Wade one and he swallowed it dry. He was quiet for a while and then he said slowly, \'I remember something. Do something for me. I wrote some crazy stuff. I don\'t want Eileen to see it. It\'s on the typewriter. Tear it up for me.\' I said I would. Then I thought he had fallen asleep until he opened his eyes again and asked \'Ever kill a man, Marlowe?\' \'Yes.\' \'Nasty feeling, isn\'t it?\' \'Some people like it,\' I said. \'How could they?\' he asked, and then he was asleep for real. I waited a minute and then I turned out the light and left him. I went downstairs. Eileen wasn\'t there, so she must have been up in her room. I wondered about that. Didn\'t she want to know how her husband was? Or was she just too tired of the trouble he caused? Maybe she didn\'t love him as much as she said she did. About that I didn\'t know. No one can see into someone else\'s heart, not even a good detective. I went to his study and found the papers. I began reading them. He was right, it was crazy stuff. He wrote about the moon watching him and wanting to scream and Verringer. He wrote bad things about Verringer, but in a kind way. Then he said he was a rose and talked about a woman who was sleeping in complete silence and that was wrong, he wrote, because you always make one sound or another when you sleep. Then he said he had given Candy too much money, he ought to have killed him instead. \'A good man died for me once, why not that insect in his stupid white jacket?\' Then he began to come out of whatever bad dream he was having and he wrote that he had to call someone, he was in a bad way. And that was the end. That\'s where he stopped writing. I didn\'t tear the papers up. I folded them and put them in my pocket. I stood there looking out of the window at the calm dark lake. Then I heard a shot. Her room was empty so I kept running. She was in his room, and they were struggling. Before I could help her, she had pulled the gun from his hands. She fell against me as she pulled the gun free, and I held her. She was crying. \'Roger, how could you?\' \'I saw someone. He had a knife. I grabbed the gun from the drawer here,\' he pointed to the little table where I\'d found the pills, \'and I shot. But it must have been a dream, because no one was there.\' It was a miserable story from start to finish. The gun hadn\'t been in the drawer. I had seen the pills, some papers, a set of keys. But no gun. And she just wasn\'t strong enough to have taken the gun from him unless he wasn\'t really fighting. It had all been a performance. He wanted sympathy, I guessed. Poor Roger is trying to kill himself, he wanted her to think. \'Go back to bed,\' I told her. \'He won\'t do it again.\' I took the gun. She gave me a hard look and then walked out. \'You were just playing,\' I told him when she had left. \'You don\'t want to die.\' \'I guess I don\'t,\' he said. \'What good man died for you?\' I asked him. At first, he didn\'t understand, and then he remembered. \'I told you, it was crazy stuff. I was drunk.\' \'And isn\'t Candy taking your money because he knows something he shouldn\'t?\' He closed his eyes and repeated \'It was just crazy stuff.\' I closed the door and came back and sat on the bed and said \'You can\'t keep running. Candy does know something. What is it, a woman?\' His eyes were still closed. \'Maybe you believe that fool doctor.\' I took a wild guess. \'No, he\'s wrong. It wasn\'t his wife, it was her sister Sylvia.\' Wade opened his eyes wide. \'Is that why you\'re here?\' he whispered, and I knew I had guessed right. \'You leave me alone,\' he said. \'I\'m not the first husband to do what I did.\' I didn\'t ask him just what he had done. \'It\'s been hell,\' he said. \'That\'s obvious. The interesting point is why.\' I gave him another one of his wife\'s pills and watched him fall asleep again. When he was finally in dreamland, he looked half-dead. He wasn\'t going to hurt anyone tonight. Maybe he had never hurt anyone at all. I went down the hall but at the top of the stairs I stopped because Eileen was standing in the doorway of her room. \'He\'s gone back to sleep,\' I said. \'I knew you would return,\' she said softly. Her voice was changed. \'Even after ten years, I haven\'t stopped waiting.\' Wonderful, I thought. Now she\'s crazy, too. \'Come in and shut the door,\' she whispered, and went into her room. I followed her in because it seemed like a good idea. She threw herself into my arms. \'It\'s always been you,\' she said, and I knew she wasn\'t talking to me. I might have done the wrong thing but Candy saved me. I heard his footsteps stop at the door and I jumped and opened it and he ran down the stairs. When I came back to the room, all I saw was a crazy woman talking to herself. I closed the door and went down to the study and found Wade\'s bottle and poured myself a big drink. Then I poured another. I lay down on the sofa there and soon the bottle was empty and I fell asleep, too. I woke up with a head like a dead tree, and the first thing I saw was Candy. He wasn\'t smiling. He asked me if I wanted coffee. \'Sure. Thanks.\' \'Slept down here? She threw you out?\' \'Whatever you say, pal.\' He laughed at me. \'You don\'t look so tough this morning.\' He brought me my coffee. I drank it, I had more, smoked a cigarette and then I was OK. I mean I was still alive. When Candy came to take the empty cup, I asked him \'How much are you getting for your silence? I bet less than two hundred.\' He smiled a bad smile. He still didn\'t like me. \'Maybe you give me two hundred so I don\'t say what I saw last night.\' \'You didn\'t see anything. There was nothing to see. Now get out of here, Candy, because I\'m waking up.\' I went to the living room. She was there and she was surprised to see me. \'I didn\'t know you were here, Mr Marlowe.\' She was hard to believe. I walked over closer to her. She was wearing something strange on a chain around her neck. It was some kind of army badge. I asked her about it. \'I had a peculiar dream last night,\' she said. \'Someone I used to know came to see me. That\'s why I\'m wearing this.\' She touched the badge gently. \'He gave it to me.\' \'I had a peculiar dream, too,\' I said, looking right at her, \'but now I\'m awake and I don\'t dream when I\'m awake. What I\'m saying is I don\'t think I\'ll come here again. There\'s something wrong here. Very wrong.\' \'Oh, Roger will be fine in a day or two. You\'ll see.\' \'No, he won\'t,\' I said. \'If you want to help him, you\'ll get him the right kind of doctor - and quick. But,\' I added, not caring that it was nasty, \'I don\'t think you really want to help him.\' I left her there in her living room, her husband upstairs sleeping a drugged sleep, her pretty necklace around her pretty neck, and her pretty violet eyes full of anger at what I had said. I drove home down a beautiful road and saw nothing beautiful.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30924, 11701),
(30927, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 8 The Smell of Gunsmoke At home, I had a long shower, shaved, changed into fresh clothes and began to feel clean again. I read a story in a magazine that was good but not great. At midday my telephone rang. It was the Doctor\'s wife. She said she had to see me. I told her I\'d meet her at my office. I stopped for a sandwich on the way so she was already there when I came in. I never remember to lock up. \'You don\'t even have a secretary,\' she said. \'No, I don\'t. Why, are you looking for a job?\' \'You couldn\'t pay me enough,\' she said. \'You\'re wrong. I\'ve got money. I\'ve got a five-thousand-dollar bill.\' I took it out of my safe and she looked at it carefully. \'You got this from Terry Lennox. He used to carry it around. A good luck piece or something. You drove him to Tijuana. You also don\'t think he killed my sister. Did he give you a list of her special friends, is that it? Is that why you\'ve been at the Wade\'s, holding Roger\'s hand? Because you think maybe Roger killed Sylvia when he was, I don\'t know, drunk and crazy?\' \'I met the Wades because a New York publisher wants a book finished, Mrs Loring. Terry gave me no list, no names. And yes, I was supposed to help Wade but I can\'t.\' That was all the explanation she deserved. But there was a question I wanted answered, too. \'I saw you at Victor\'s the other night. You were having a rather unusual drink, I noticed. Could it be that you don\'t think Terry killed your sister?\' \'What I think doesn\'t matter,\' she said. She meant it, too. \'I didn\'t come here to talk about Terry Lennox in any case. I came to invite you to my house.\' \'Why?\' \'Someone would like to talk with you.\' I had a strong feeling who that someone would be. \'The old man?\' She frowned. It was a pretty frown. \'I don\'t call him that, Mr Marlowe. Will you come?\' I said yes. Even a cat can look at a king. We went in her car. The driver was a black man in his middle fifties who even opened our doors when we stopped in front of her house, which was just about the ugliest piece of architecture I had ever seen. It looked like a sandcastle that a little boy builds when he\'s mad at his parents. Mrs Loring saw my expression and smiled. \'Horrible, isn\'t it? My father gave it to me as a wedding present. My husband loves it.\' We went in. Someone opened the door for us and then vanished. From the hall we entered a room that was at least seventy feet long. At the far end, a man was sitting, waiting. He gave us both the same cold stare. Mrs Loring made the introductions and apologized just in case we were late. \'Tell them to bring the tea,\' he said. \'Sit down, Mr Marlowe.\' I sat down and we looked at each other without talking at all until the tea came. \'Two cups,\' Harlan Potter commanded as his daughter poured. \'You can have your tea in another room, Linda.\' She smiled weakly and left. I took out a cigarette. \'Don\'t smoke, please. It bothers my health.\' I had to believe him, although he certainly didn\'t look sick. He was a long way over six feet and nearly as wide as he was tall. His hair was not yet grey. His voice seemed to come from the next room. So this is what a hundred million dollars looks like, I thought. He didn\'t even touch his tea. He just talked. He said he knew who I was, what I was, and what I had done for Terry. He went on to say that my investigation was interfering in his private life. I told him I wasn\'t investigating anything at the moment. He disagreed. \'Perhaps you think Roger Wade is involved in my daughter\'s death. Forget that idea. Forget you even know Roger Wade. I don\'t read his books myself,\' he said, \'but I have been told that they are quite childish. As childish as whatever strange ideas you may have.\' I explained again how I had come to meet Wade. I told him about Menendez, too, but he said the name meant nothing to him. I asked him what I could do to make him happier. \'All I want is peace and quiet, Mr Marlowe. I pay good money for it, and I expect it. We live in a dirty world where everyone wants to hear terrible stories about the rich and the powerful. I repeat; I pay money to keep my life private. How much do you want, Marlowe?\' \'Nothing, I don\'t want your money. If I get rich, I might become like you.\' He laughed. Then he stood up and I saw just how much over six feet he was. He was very big. When he shook my hand, my fingers cried. \'Just don\'t be a hero, young man. It\'s not a very clever role for a clever man.\' Mrs Loring\'s driver took me home but wouldn\'t accept the dollar I tried to give him. So I tried to give him a book of poetry, but he said he already had that book. Life left me alone again for another week and then I got two telephone calls in one morning, and I was back into what Harlan Potter had clearly told me to stay away from. The first caller was Roger Wade. He wasn\'t crying for help this time; he was inviting me to lunch. I accepted. The second call was from that friend of George Peters. He was back in town. He said he didn\'t know if it would help now, but he was sure he had seen Terry Lennox in New York a few years back, and that his name then had been Paul Marston. He added that Marston had been wearing a British Army badge. With this new information I decided to talk to someone who was supposed to know what was going on. I telephoned Green at Homicide. He wasn\'t pleased to hear from me. \'War record? You don\'t listen, do you, Marlowe? The investigation is over. But if you can\'t sleep nights worrying about it, I\'ll tell you. Lennox had no war record.\' I told him Mendy\'s story. \'Mendy is a gangster. He is also a liar. And you\'re a fool to believe him.\' He didn\'t give me a chance to tell him what I thought he was. He just hung up. I drove to Wade\'s house at noon. It was too hot to be a nice day. Even the wind was hot. The house was cool, though. Wade took me into his study. A pile of papers next to the typewriter impressed me. \'The book?\' I asked. \'Yes, and it\'s rotten. I\'m not a writer anymore. I\'m someone who used to write. Want a drink?\' \'A soda, please.\' \'Very clever. I think I\'ll have one, too.\' He rang a bell and Candy came. \'Two sodas, and we\'ll have lunch in an hour,\' he told the Mexican. \'It\'s Thursday, boss. My day off, remember?\' \'Then just make us some sandwiches.\' \'I\'m not the cook, boss.\' Wade gave him a narrow look. \'I\'m having lunch with my friend. The cook is off today.\' \'You think he\'s your friend,\' Candy said, glancing at me, \'maybe you should ask your wife.\' \'Watch your mouth, little man,\' Wade warned, suddenly angry. \'Remember who pays you.\' Candy smiled. \'OK, boss, I\'ll get lunch.\' He left for the kitchen. \'But what are you paying him for?\' I asked Wade. \'You\'re going to start that again?\' \'And the good man that died for you? Let me tell you. Terry Lennox. Candy knows you were seeing Sylvia, so you pay him.\' Wade asked me, \'You think I killed her?\' \'I\'m not looking for her killer. What\'s driving you insane is that you don\'t know. You were drunk and you don\'t remember. That\'s how it was.\' He was going to say something but Candy came in carrying the sandwiches and two bottles of beer. Wade looked at the beer and shook his head. \'Get me a real drink, Candy.\' The Mexican said there was only beer and that he was leaving now; he reminded Wade again that it was his day off. \'So go. I\'ll get the stuff myself.\' They left the room together and then Wade returned a minute later with a bottle of whisky and a glass. He filled it, drank, then filled it again. \'Where\'s your wife?\' I asked him as he put the bottle and the glass down on his desk. \'Why? Are you in love?\' The whisky was already at work. \'I ask because I don\'t want to leave you alone, now that you\'re going to fall to pieces again. I wouldn\'t want you to shoot the ceiling again.\' He looked at me with deep worry in his eyes. \'I really did that, didn\'t I? You know, I can\'t remember.\' \'That\'s your whole trouble,\' I told him. \'Is the gun still in the desk?\' I had put it there that night. Today, I didn\'t want him in the same room with it. \'I don\'t know where it is, but it\'s not in the desk,\' he said. \'Look for yourself.\' I did, and it wasn\'t there. Eileen must have hidden it from him. \'Now that you\'ve had your look around,\' he said, the whisky in charge once more, \'why don\'t you leave me alone? I\'m tired of your face.\' I took my sandwich to a table and some chairs outside. It was a little hotter here, but it was nicer than being with Wade. I watched a boat zip up and down the lake. The people in the boat were laughing. They were talking to each other but I couldn\'t hear anything except the loud roar of the boat\'s engine. After I finished my sandwich, I went back and put my head in at the door of the study. \'Go away,\' Wade said, and shook the half-empty whisky bottle at me. I went back outside to wait for someone to come home and keep an eye on the fool. The boat continued to roar along the shore of the lake. I walked down to get a closer look. The man behind the wheel waved at me. Maybe he didn\'t know he was wrecking a nice quiet afternoon and maybe he knew and didn\'t care. I walked back to the house. The boat moved down the lake and took its awful noise with it. At the top of the garden steps, I heard the doorbell ringing. I went in and opened the door for Eileen Wade. \'Oh, Mr Marlowe. I thought it was Candy or Roger. I forgot my key.\' \'It\'s Candy\'s day off.\' There must have been something in my voice. \'Is anything wrong?\' she asked. \'Well, a little drinking is being done. He\'s in his study. Probably asleep by now. And I must get going.\' \'Oh, don\'t go. Stay and have some tea.\' I don\'t know why I said yes. I didn\'t want any tea. She took off her jacket. \'I\'ll just look in and see if Roger is all right.\' I watched her cross to the study door and open it. She looked in for a moment and closed the door and came back. \'Yes, he\'s asleep. I have to go upstairs, but I\'ll be right back down.\' She went up and I heard her door close. I went to the study. If he was sleeping, he wouldn\'t need whatever was left in the bottle. I opened the door. There was perfect silence and a strong smell of gunsmoke in the room. Before I was half-way to where he lay on the sofa, I knew he was dead.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30926, 11701),
(30929, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 9 The Kiss of Death Beside him on the sofa was the gun. It was bloodstained. The side of his head was more than bloodstained. I touched his wrist. It was warm but he was quite dead. I looked around for a note but there wasn\'t one. They don\'t always leave notes. I wondered why I hadn\'t heard the shot and then I remembered the boat. He must have waited until the boat was passing, and then fired the bullet. Why would he wait for the boat? I didn\'t like that but nobody cared what I liked. I went out and closed the door. She was in the kitchen making our tea. I didn\'t say anything except that I didn\'t take sugar or milk. She said she\'d learned to drink tea in London, during the war. When she met that man - but she stopped the story there and changed the subject. She started talking about her husband - something would have to be done to help him. I said it was too late. She didn\'t understand that remark at first, then she glanced towards the study. \'Is. . . is there something wrong in there?\' I nodded. She ran out of the kitchen and by the time I reached her she was kneeling by the sofa. I left her there with him and called the police. A cop was at the house within five minutes. When I took him to the study, she was still kneeling by the body. \'I\'m sorry,\' he said, \'but you really shouldn\'t touch anything.\' \'It\'s my husband,\' she said angrily. \'He\'s been shot.\' She looked right at me. \'I think he did it,\' she said, pointing. It wasn\'t a nice thing to say, but I got lucky. The police detective who showed up ten minutes later was my friend Bernie Ohls. He was my friend but that didn\'t mean he didn\'t have to think about it first. \'You were here with him alone, right? She says you knew where the gun was. Although it looks more like suicide right now. And you\'re maybe too clever to be the only person around when you kill someone. Maybe, but I think you would have done it differently.\' \'Thanks, Bernie. You\'re right, though; I would have.\' \'So it looks good for suicide. Except that Wade was rich, his beautiful wife is upstairs crying for him, and I can\'t see why he\'d want to kill himself. If you know ... if you know anything, you\'d better be ready to talk. I\'ll see you later. Maybe sooner.\' As it turned out, I had time to go home, change, have a nice dinner out and come home again before Ohls called. The message was simple: come to the sheriff\'s office and don\'t bother stopping to buy flowers. The Wade house was in Idle Valley, outside the city border. Idle Valley had its own sheriff, and he was investigating Wade\'s death. In theory, the sheriff ran his own office, but the sheriff was as stupid as he was honest, and he was very honest. He looked great in photographs and he was almost as big as the horse he rode in the annual Idle Valley Festival, but the horse was cleverer. The sheriff knew it and he let his captain, a man named Hernandez, do the real police work. It was Hernandez and Ohls who threw the questions at me. How did I first meet Wade? When? What work did I do for him? I told them the truth, but I didn\'t tell everything. Then we reached the part that most interested Hernandez. \'The night that Wade fired a gun in his bedroom you went into Eileen Wade\'s room and you were in there together for some time with the door shut. How long would you say you spent in there?\' \'About three minutes.\' Hernandez shook his head. \'I suggest you were in there for a few hours,\' he said coldly. I looked at Ohls but Bernie wouldn\'t look at me. \'Three minutes,\' I repeated. \'Get that servant in here,\' Hernandez said. Ohls went out and came back with Candy. I knew what was coming. Candy told his story in a low nasty voice. He said he\'d seen me go into the bedroom and that he had come up the stairs and listened at the door and heard whispers. He said I didn\'t come out for a long time. When he had finished, he gave me a hard look and I could see hate in his eyes. The captain said \'Take him out.\' \'Just a minute,\' I said. \'I\'d like to ask him a question.\' Hernandez didn\'t like that but he let me. \'Where were you when you saw me go into her bedroom?\' \'I was cleaning up the glasses at the bar.\' \'And you saw me go into her bedroom and close the door?\' Candy said yes. \'You\'re lying. You can\'t see that door from the bar. I\'m four inches taller than you and when I stood at the bar at the party, I couldn\'t see more than the top edge of that door.\' Candy did not deny this. He said nothing at all. Hernandez asked \'What about how long you were in the room?\' I said that was my word against Candy\'s, and I reminded them that Candy had just lied. He could believe either of us, I told him. Hernandez sent Candy out. Then he told me I could go home but that I\'d have to come back the next day to sign the statement I\'d made. He even shook my hand when I left. I guessed that meant he believed me. *** A few days later, they closed that investigation, too. It was suicide, they said. Ohls came over that afternoon. It was over but that didn\'t mean he had to like the answer. \'Wade was a writer, Marlowe. That\'s what bothers me. He wrote books, he wrote notes to himself, he wrote all the time. And then he kills himself and he doesn\'t even write a goodbye. It seems wrong.\' I pointed out that Wade had been drunk. That didn\'t satisfy Bernie. \'There\'s the boat, too. Why would you care if anyone heard the last shot you\'d ever fire? Or the wife who forgets her keys and has to ring the bell to get in when she could have walked around to the back of the house and come in from the garden? I\'ve been a policeman too long and it just doesn\'t smell right. I would swear she did it except there\'s no motive. She could have divorced him and still made a fortune.\' He talked for an hour about the Wades, and for an hour I talked about them, too, but all my talk couldn\'t cover up the fact that I wasn\'t telling him everything. He left angry; angry at everybody, including me. I talked to someone else the next day who wasn\'t any happier about Wade\'s death than Bernie was, but for different reasons. Howard Spencer called from New York to say he\'d been informed of the suicide, and that he\'d heard I was somehow involved. I found myself explaining everything again. I was getting tired of apologizing for what Wade had chosen to do. In fact, the more I thought about him, the less I liked this dead man. Spencer said he was going to fly in one day soon; we said we\'d talk then, although I had nothing more to say. Roger Wade was dead and so was Terry Lennox, but there was a difference; I still cared about Terry. I called Mendy to get some facts straight. \'Mendy, this is Marlowe.\' \'Hello, Cheapie, how are you.\' \'Haven\'t you heard? Another friend of mine killed himself. They\'re going to call me the Kiss of Death from now on. I also have a question. About Paul Marston.\' \'Never heard of him,\' Mendy said immediately. \'No games, Mendy. That was the name Lennox used in New York and probably before there.\' \'So?\' \'There are no army records under either name. That story of yours was all a song.\' Mendy didn\'t like being called a liar. \'I never said where it happened. Take my advice and forget the whole thing. You were told. Now stay told.\' \'Some types scare me, Mendy, but you\'re not one of them. Ever been to England?\' He ignored my question. Instead he said \'Big Willie Magoon wasn\'t scared, either. Seen the newspapers? Maybe he\'s still not scared but I doubt it. He\'s in the hospital and he\'s going to be there a long time.\' \'I don\'t want to talk about Magoon. I want to talk about England and you and Randy Starr and Paul Marston.\' There was a short silence on his end of the line. Then he made up his mind. \'OK, Cheapie. I tell you the whole story and then your curiosity dies, right? Otherwise you do. We were with the British. It happened in Norway, in November 1942. Now you know it all. Now you can rest your tired brain.\' He hung up. I went out and bought a newspaper and read about poor Magoon. Of course, Mendy had promised me worse, because Magoon was a policeman, a dirty cop but still one of the boys, and gangsters don\'t like to kill policemen. They don\'t care about private detectives, though. Some days it seems no one does. Except perhaps another private detective. I called George Peters and asked him to help. He said he would. \'I know a few good people in England. You\'ll get what you want.\' *** He didn\'t disappoint me. When Howard Spencer called the next Friday, I had it all. He was staying at the Ritz-Beverly Hotel, and he suggested we meet in the bar. But I wanted to talk in private, so I went to his room instead. He had it nice. The room was big, and the view was good. He ordered our drinks over the telephone. \'Now, Mr Marlowe, what can you tell me before I see Mrs Wade?\' \'Nothing.\' He looked at me with surprise. \'I mean concerning Roger Wade\'s death. I understand you were there.\' I nodded. \'I\'d like to come with you to see Mrs Wade,\' I said. Spencer shook his head. \'I don\'t think she wishes to see you. She blames you, in part, for what happened, I think.\' \'She told the police I killed him. I know she doesn\'t want to see me. That\'s why I want to go with you. I want a witness to what I have to say to her, too.\' \'What are you going to say?\' \'You hear it in front of her or not at all,\' I said. \'Then not at all. Eileen has suffered enough. I won\'t take you there to bother her more.\' That made sense. He wanted the book that Wade had been working on. He wanted to save Eileen Wade from more pain. I said that these were fine aims but I didn\'t share them. All I wanted was a clearer picture. I told him the details that had bothered Ohls. \'My God,\' he said, \'the police don\'t think Eileen did it, do they?\' I didn\'t tell him the investigation was closed. I just gave him a tired smile and let him do his own thinking. \'You want to talk to her, and you want a witness. I hope to God you\'re crazy, but I\'ll do it,\' he said finally.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30928, 11701);

(30931, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 10 A Big Noise About Small Things The drive to Idle Valley was long and hot, as always. I expected the heat but Spencer was shocked. \'This heat, this dust. I thought California was supposed to have beautiful weather.\' I told him it would be cooler by the lake. \'It was a mistake for Roger to move here, you know. Wrong environment entirely. Too many parties, this awful heat, no wonder he didn\'t feel like writing. A writer needs things to think about; and not just what he\'s going to wear to the next good time.\' I didn\'t have a chance to disagree with him because we had reached the house. Spencer was out of the car as soon as I had parked, and he rang the bell as soon as he got to the door. Candy, wearing his white jacket and his usual frown, let the publisher in and then closed the door as I approached. I rang and he put his head out. \'Get lost. Or do you want trouble?\' I pushed right past him. He reached for me but Eileen Wade was standing there and he stopped. \'Hello, Howard,\' she said warmly to Spencer. \'I\'m so sorry you missed lunch. And I didn\'t know you were bringing Mr Marlowe.\' Spencer said simply \'He wants to talk to you.\' She was surprised. \'Does he? I can\'t imagine why but do come in and sit down.\' Spencer went at once to the study for the pages Wade had written. I sat in an uncomfortable silence with Eileen Wade until I noticed that she was wearing that badge again. She had just handed it to me when Spencer returned with his pile of papers. \'It\'s the badge of an English Army group, the Artists\' Rifles they were called. The man who gave it to me was lost right afterwards, in Andalsnes in Norway, in 1940.\' \'And you were in love with him,\' I said. She admitted it proudly. \'And he had my initials.\' \'His name was quite different,\' she said coldly, \'and he is dead. Dead.\' I handed the badge to Spencer. He took it without showing interest. \'I\'ve seen it before,\' he said. \'Just help me. The picture on it is a long knife that points down and there\'s a pair of wings, too. The writing on it says \"Who dares wins\".\' Spencer was unimpressed. \'I fail to see what you are trying to say.\' \'This badge she says she was given in London in 1940 didn\'t exist then. It was created years later. And the Artists\' Rifles never fought in Andalsnes.\' Spencer put the badge down gently on the table and pushed it towards Eileen. He said nothing. \'I know that,\' Eileen said. \'There must be some mistake,\' Spencer offered. I gave him a hard stare. \'That\'s one way of putting it,\' I said. \'Another way is to say I\'m a liar,\' Eileen said angrily. \'That I never met a man named Paul Marston, that he never existed, that I bought this badge in a shop somewhere. Would that explanation satisfy you, Mr Marlowe?\' I said the shop would, but not the first part. There had been a Paul Marston once. She had certainly met him. In fact, she had done more than that. I took a folded paper from my pocket. \'She\'s forgotten a few dates, years, that\'s all,\' Spencer said. \'I don\'t see why you\'re being so tough with her.\' I smiled, but not from joy. \'She\'s forgotten a lot more than that.\' I waved the paper from my pocket. \'In August 1942, Eileen Victoria Sampsell and Paul Edward Marston were married. In a sense Mrs Wade is right. Marston never existed because that was just a name he used. In the army you have to have permission to get married. In the army, Marston had another name.\' Spencer was very quiet now. He stared, but not at both of us. He stared at her. She had to say something. \'Howard, he\'s dead, it doesn\'t matter. And Roger knew. And he didn\'t care.\' Spencer did the right thing as he saw it. He believed her. \'Let\'s forget it. Marlowe made a big show out of a badge and the marriage. That\'s all.\' She had him on her side now. She said \'Mr Marlowe makes a big noise about small things, but when it comes to saving a man\'s life-\' \'And you never saw Paul Marston again,\' I said. \'How could I when he was dead?\' \'He was not reported dead. He might have been taken prisoner.\' \'There was an order not to take prisoners,\' she said in a cold, sad voice. \'That\'s enough, Marlowe,\' Spencer interrupted. \'I think it\'s time we left.\' He began packing up the papers into his leather case. \'If that\'s what you want, Mr Spencer. But do you think I came here to tell Mrs Wade she was wearing the wrong badge? I began with Marston long before I met Mrs Wade. When I started, my Paul Marston was still alive.\' \'Marston is not such an unusual name,\' Spencer said. \'There must be many Paul Marstons.\' \'Maybe. But how many Paul Marstons would you say had big scars on their faces and snow-white hair? How many that saved the lives of two gangsters? Marston wasn\'t just Marston, Spencer. He was also Terry Lennox.\' *** I didn\'t expect anyone to jump up and scream and nobody did. There is, however, a kind of silence that is almost as loud as a shout and I had it all around me now. I sat in it for a full minute and then I turned to Eileen. She sat leaning forward. Her face was pale. When she spoke, her voice was as empty as the voice on the telephone that tells you the time, minute after minute without changing. \'I saw him once, Howard. We didn\'t speak. He was terribly changed. When I saw him he was with that awful woman. And I was married to Roger. We were lost to each other. Even if I hadn\'t been married, I couldn\'t have forgiven him for marrying her. That horrible woman. I didn\'t care that Roger went around with her; he was just my husband. Paul was much more than that to me or he was nothing. In the end he was nothing.\' She wasn\'t talking to me but I said, \'I wouldn\'t say he was nothing.\' \'Less than nothing. He knew what kind of woman she was and still he married her. Then he couldn\'t stand it and he killed her and ran away and killed himself. Nothing.\' \'He didn\'t kill her,\' I said, \'and you know it.\' She looked at me in surprise. Spencer made a funny sound in his throat. \'Roger killed her,\' I continued, \'and you also know that.\' \'Did he tell you?\' she asked quietly. \'He didn\'t have to. He would have told me sooner or later. It was driving him crazy.\' She shook her head. \'No, Mr Marlowe, what was driving him crazy was that he didn\'t know. He was so drunk when he did it that he couldn\'t remember afterwards. He tried to remember because he knew something was wrong. Perhaps that memory came back to him at the very end.\' Spencer couldn\'t believe a man could kill and forget it. Eileen smiled a very sad smile. \'I was there, Howard. I saw him do it.\' She\'s going to tell us, I thought. She can\'t stop herself now. And she talked, and we listened. She had followed Roger to Sylvia\'s guest house. An argument started between Roger and Sylvia. Eileen watched from the shadows. Roger came outside, Sylvia ran after him. She tried to hit him with a small stone vase she was holding. He took it from her and he hit her. Then he hit her again, and she fell down and he kept hitting her. Before Еilееn ran, she saw him pick Sylvia\'s body up and carry it back inside. \'When Roger came home that night I was terrified. He was covered in blood and still blind drunk. I took his clothes off him as if he were a child, and put them in an old suitcase. He went right to sleep and I drove to Chatsworth Beach on the other side of the lake and threw the suitcase in. When Roger woke up, he remembered nothing. He never said a word about the clothes. I guess he never even noticed they were missing.\' Spencer was working on something while he listened and now he had it ready. \'Wait a minute. You knew Roger had killed Sylvia and yet you had me hire Marlowe, or try to hire him, to find out the terrible secret that was bothering your husband. That doesn\'t make sense. Unless. . .\' He gave her a strange look, as if seeing her for the first time, \'Unless the idea was that Marlowe would find the truth and maybe tell Wade that the whole world would have to know. So Roger would take that gun and do just what he did anyway.\' She looked at Spencer with tears in her eyes. \'That\'s horrible, Howard. You know I could never-\' \'I don\'t know,\' Spencer said coolly. \'But you know. Did you?\' \'Did I what?\' she asked. \'Shoot Roger,\' he said calmly. \'You\'re horrible. He was my husband. I forgot my key, I came in, he was already dead.\' Spencer shook his head. \'I\'ve stayed here a dozen times, Eileen, and I\'ve never known the front door to be locked.\' She stood up. \'Howard, take the book and go. Call the police if you think I killed Roger. But don\'t ever come back here.\' I wanted one last answer. \'Wait a minute, Mrs Wade. Let\'s finish the job. We\'re all trying to do the right thing. That old suitcase you threw in the lake at Chatsworth Beach ? was it heavy?\' \'Yes, it was.\' \'So how did you get it over that high fence? They close the gate there after dark.\' She thought about it. \'The fence. I had a hard time with the fence but I got it over.\' \'There isn\'t any fence,\' I said. \'Isn\'t any fence?\' she repeated. \'And Sylvia Lennox was killed inside the guest house, on the bed. And there are other details you missed.\' She said nothing, she just walked away. We watched her go up the stairs. We heard her bedroom door close. \'What was that about the fence?\' Spencer asked. He looked like a man who\'d just fought a battle. He was tired in that way. \'A bad joke. I\'ve never been near Chatsworth Beach. It might have a fence and it might not.\' \'I see,\' he said unhappily. \'But she didn\'t know, either.\' \'Of course not. Which means she killed them both.\' Then something moved behind me and Candy was standing there. He was playing with his knife again but this time he wasn\'t thinking about giving me the blade. \'I\'m sorry, Senor,\' he said to me. \'I was wrong about you. She killed the boss.\' He looked at his knife again. \'No,\' I said. I stood up and held out my hand. \'Give me the knife, Candy. To the cops you\'re just a Mexican servant. They\'d arrest you for it and love it. They\'ve made a mess of this from start to finish, and they\'d use you to make people forget that. You\'d spend the rest of your life in jail.\' He put the knife in my hand. \'Only for you I do this.\' I put the knife in my pocket. Candy asked what would happen now. I said we\'d do nothing, but Spencer insisted we had to do something. He mentioned calling the police. \'Tomorrow. Or let them catch her themselves. We don\'t have enough proof. The truth is not legal proof. If it was, we wouldn\'t have lawyers.\' In the end Spencer said he\'d do whatever I thought was best. He was OK, he was doing fine, but this wasn\'t something he knew about. It wasn\'t books. We left. As I walked out, I handed Candy back his knife. \'Don\'t do a thing. Nobody trusts me but I trust you, Candy.\' \'Thank you, Senor. I trust you, too.\' I returned Spencer to his hotel and went home. I watched the clock and the hours went slowly. I fell asleep very late and the telephone rang in the middle of my first dream. \'Yes?\' \'This is Candy, Senor. The lady is dead.\' It\'s a hard word, dead, and when he said it he made it sound like stone. \'She took some pills, I think.\' \'Have you called the police?\' \'Not yet,\' he said. \'Call them. Was there a note?\' \'Yes, a letter.\' \'Give it to them when they come. And tell them everything and this time only the truth, right?\' \'Yes, Senor. I\'ll call them right now.\'', 1, 1, 0, '', 30930, 11701),
(30933, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 11 A Little Trap I hung up and took a shower and shaved. I dressed quickly because I knew I didn\'t have much time. I was tying my shoes when my time ran out. \'Hello, Marlowe,\' Bernie Ohls said when I picked up the telephone. \'Come down here and suffer.\' It was different this time. It was another suicide but this was the real thing. They were not happy with me but there was nothing they could threaten me with. Hernandez listened to my story and this time he didn\'t make any suggestions as to what else I might want to say. There was Eileen Wade\'s full confession, too, but the DA didn\'t want it because he had already believed another confession to the Lennox murder. The sheriff\'s office, on the other hand, liked the confession. They liked it because they didn\'t like the DA. Dr Loring showed up because she had been his patient and she had killed herself with his medicine. We were not glad to see each other. After the doctor left, I was told I could go, too. Ohls took me out through another room. He pointed out a small pile of papers on a desk. \'Copies of the confession. It would be terrible if someone took one of them. The DA doesn\'t want this to become public.\' Then he went out into the hall to get some air, leaving me alone. He came back a minute later. When we were out in the sunlight, I asked him \'You don\'t like the DA, do you, Bernie?\' Ohls smiled. \'I like everybody. I even like you. Not everyone does, though, and in a few days fewer people will like you, I think. I hope you still carry a gun.\' \'I do,\' I said, \'but it doesn\'t always help. The newspapers said that Willie Magoon was carrying two of them the night they put him in hospital.\' \'That\'s right,\' Ohls said. \'It would be a good idea to remember that.\' When I got home, I called Morgan, the reporter who\'d given me the ride home from the police station that other time. We had a long conversation. He tried to persuade me not to do it, but he couldn\'t, and he was still a reporter and he wanted the story. He did warn me, though. \'When we print this confession, you\'re going to be the least popular person in town. The DA will know sooner or later where it came from. Potter will be so angry he might forget he\'s a gentleman. And Mendy will be angry, too, because he told you to leave it alone, and Mendy doesn\'t even pretend to be a gentleman.\' It was all true, and his advice was good advice. \'Print it, Morgan,\' I said, and I read the whole letter to him from the copy I\'d taken from the Sheriff\'s office. It came out the next day, on the front page. The DA called it lies but the newspaper sold very well. Bernie Ohls came over and we had another bad time together. He wondered why I hadn\'t called him with what I\'d had against Eileen Wade. He said maybe I wanted her dead. I said I had just wanted her to take a long look at what she had done to two good men. \'You think you\'re a clever monkey, don\'t you, Marlowe?\' \'What do you want me to say?\' \'Nothing. It\'s too late. The hard boys will come for you. And it\'s very quiet here. Dark and quiet.\' \'Why are you even here, Bernie? We were friends once but you can\'t really be friends with a cop, can you? Not a tough old one like you.\' He finished his beer and left. The day ended with some good songs on the radio. *** The next day the DA made a full statement attacking Morgan\'s newspaper and he said a lot of pretty things about poor Mrs Wade and still the newspaper held to its position. I went to my office and did nothing special, nothing that I can remember, until the workday was over. I ate at a restaurant on the way home. I drove up Locust Avenue and it was as empty as usual. I parked and went up all my steps. I would have unlocked the door but it was already a few inches open. \'Come on in, Cheapie,\' a familiar voice said. \'Welcome home.\' If I had taken my gun out right then I could have shot him. But I stood still a moment too long and someone slipped out of the bushes and pushed me through my own doorway. Mendy was wearing another expensive suit and the same nasty smile. I didn\'t see him at first, though, because I was looking at the other man sitting in the corner of my living room. He had a gun lying across his knees and he was so brown from the sun that there in the half-dark I couldn\'t see his face at all. Mendy wanted my attention. The man that had pushed me reminded me of that in a soft place on my arm. The pain disappeared very quickly but with it went the muscle in my arm. I looked at him. He was a big Mexican. He was tough. There is nothing tougher than a tough Mexican, just as there is nothing gentler than a gentle Mexican, or more honest than an honest Mexican, or, above all, nothing sadder than a sad Mexican, This guy was one of the hard ones. They don\'t come any harder anywhere. Mendy stood in front of me. I was very interested in the gun in his right hand, and it looked interested in me. \'You didn\'t listen, Cheapie.\' He hit me with the gun. It hurt. \'You shouldn\'t have to do this yourself,\' I said, surprised that my mouth still worked. \'You should have some boys do it for you. Like you did to Willie Magoon.\' He smiled again. \'No, Magoon was business. He tried to push me. He bought that big car of his with my money and then he tried to push me. You, Marlowe, are personal. You embarrassed me professionally. I can\'t let you do that.\' I shook my head. \'There\'s more to it than that. What happened? Your friend Lennox was innocent but you never moved a finger to prove it, and then I came and did the work you should have done. He saved your life and you didn\'t do anything. Because you\'re no friend, and you\'re not big, you\'re just a loud boy who can\'t think of anyone but himself.\' His face froze and he lifted the gun to hit me again. I didn\'t think; I didn\'t have a plan. I was just tired of being hit. I kicked him full in the stomach. As he went down, I hit him again, with my knee. Then I waited to be shot, and nothing happened. I looked around. The hard one was standing by the door, watching me. He didn\'t even bother to look at Mendy, who was now lying on the floor, gasping. At last, the man in the chair moved. He stood up, put his gun away, and laughed. \'Don\'t kill him, Marlowe, we need him alive.\' That was when Bernie Ohls walked in, whistling. \'Hello, Marlowe. You\'ve cut your face.\' He gestured at Mendy, who was still on the floor. \'Take this soft baby out of here,\' he ordered the laughing man. \'He\'s not soft,\' I said. \'He\'s hurt. Anybody can be hurt. Was Willie Magoon soft?\' \'No,\' Ohls admitted. \'And now we\'ve got the words from Mendy\'s own mouth about Magoon. Because gangsters can\'t touch policemen in this town. It\'s against all the rules. We will remind Mendy of that. It worked well, this little trap. A few cuts on your face, but I\'d say you deserved them.\' They led Mendy away and left me alone in my dark, quiet house. I thought about it for a few minutes and then I made a telephone call. \'Marlowe? I know that name. Right, a friend of Terry\'s. How can I help you?\' He had a businessman\'s calm voice. \'You can tell me about Mexico, Mr Starr. I just had a visit from Mendy and I don\'t think he was mad at me for . . . something in the newspaper. It was Mexico. Something is wrong here. The confession Lennox wrote was false. How many other lies are there? He wrote me a letter which was mailed by someone. Who?\' Randy Starr said \'I have no idea, Mr Marlowe.\' \'I think you should find out, Mr Starr. If you don\'t, someone else will.\' \'You, Marlowe?\' He didn\'t sound like the calm businessman now. \'Not me. A man so big you could get hurt if he sneezed. So find out, Mr Starr.\' The next day I went to see the lawyer who had been to Mexico to watch them bury Lennox. He was surprised to see me but was not unfriendly. \'You\'re a stubborn one, aren\'t you, Marlowe? Still digging?\' \'Yes, Mr Endicott, still digging. I wonder if you could give me a few minutes?\' \'Why not?\' he said. \'Can I assume that you were representing Harlan Potter when you came to see me in jail?\' Endicott nodded. \'I suppose Potter is very unhappy with me these days,\' I continued, but to my surprise the lawyer said he wasn\'t. \'Mr Potter blames his son-in-law, Dr Loring. He feels that if that Wade woman hadn\'t been using those drugs that the doctor gave her, none of this would have happened.\' \'He\'s wrong. You saw Terry\'s body in Otatoclan, didn\'t you?\' \'I did indeed.\' \'He didn\'t look the same, did he?\' \'You mean the colour? No, he was darker, much darker. His hair was black. But the scar was still there and we took his fingerprints. There\'s no question it was him.\' I asked him the next question twice before he understood it. \'A mailbox? No, I don\'t remember seeing a mailbox.\' I showed him Terry\'s letter. He read it slowly. \'I wonder why he did it,\' he said when he had finished reading. \'Why he sent the letter?\' \'No, of course not. Why he confessed and killed himself. As for the mailbox, perhaps he saw something that looked like one. Otatoclan isn\'t a modern town.\' \'I know,\' I said. \'I looked it up. A population of one thousand, no good roads, a small local airport, one hotel. Not a place you\'d find a mailbox.\' Endicott was trying to understand. \'What do you think it would mean if there wasn\'t a mailbox?\' I said I didn\'t know. What I didn\'t say was that I was sure I would find out one day.', 1, 1, 0, '', 30932, 11701),
(30935, 'A Long Goodbye by Raymond Chandler Part 12 The Long Goodbye A month went by in which I learned nothing new. Then I came into the office one day and found a stranger waiting for me. A tall, well-dressed Mexican. He sat by the open window smoking a brown cigarette that smelled strong. He was wearing his black hair longer than we do north of the border. He was also wearing green sunglasses. He stood up politely. \'Senor Marlowe?\' \'What can I do for you?\' He handed me a folded piece of paper and told me in Spanish that it was an introduction from Senor Starr of Las Vegas. \'Let\'s speak English,\' I said, \'if you speak English.\' \'Of course I do,\' he said. He didn\'t have much of an accent, but he spoke in the American Spanish way, stressing every second or third word in his sentences. I unfolded the paper and read \'This introduces a friend of mine, Cisco Maioranos. I think he can help you. S.\' \'Let\'s go into my office, Senor Maioranos,\' I said, and held the inner door open for him. I smelled perfume as he went past me. He had a thin, neat moustache. He looked delicate and harmless. Except he probably wasn\'t as delicate as he looked, because he had knife scars on both cheeks. \'You wish to know about Senor Lennox,\' he said as he sat down. \'I was working at the hotel in Otatoclan.\' \'You don\'t look the type.\' \'Sometimes life is difficult,\' he said. \'Who mailed the letter to me?\' \'I mailed it,\' he said. He took out a cigarette case and offered it to me as he lit another cigarette for himself. \'I don\'t like Cuban cigarettes, thank you. You mailed the letter?\' \'That\'s correct. The boy was afraid to go up to the room because there was a policeman outside the door. A cop, as you say. So I went up and he gave me the letter.\' \'There was a lot of money in that letter, Senor Maioranos. You should have looked inside.\' \'The letter was not open,\' he said coldly. \'I am an honest man.\' \'I apologize. Continue please.\' \'I went into his room with the coffee. He was holding a gun. The letter was on the table. He told me to take it and go. He gave me some money. Naturally, I gave it to the boy later.\' \'I was on my way down the stairs when I heard the shot. I hid the letter and came right back. The police were in the room. Senor Lennox was dead.\' I asked him if the hotel had been full. He thought for a moment. He lit another Cuban cigarette. \'No,\' he said, \'it was not full. Perhaps six or seven guests.\' \'Americans?\' I asked. \'Yes, two American hunters. One of them spoke border Spanish, I think.\' \'Did they go near Lennox\'s room at all?\' \'Why should they?\' It wasn\'t an answer but I couldn\'t see his eyes because of the sunglasses, so I didn\'t know why he hadn\'t answered. \'Well,\' I said, standing up, \'it was nice of you to come here. You can thank Randy for me. And you can tell him, too, that next time he can send somebody that knows what he\'s talking about.\' He stared at me hard. I looked at those knife scars again. He had not always been a polite man in a hotel. He did not like being doubted. \'Let\'s try this,\' I said. \'The two Americans were two men named Menendez and Starr. They did go into Lennox\'s room. Lennox knew they were there. He knew why. He wrote me that letter because he felt guilty. He had tricked me and a man like Lennox doesn\'t like tricking his friends. By the way, did you put the letter in the mailbox?\' Maioranos frowned. \'Mailbox? Otatoclan is not Mexico City, Senor. There is no mailbox.\' \'No, there isn\'t. And there was no coffee. You did not bring Lennox anything. You did not go into his room. The Americans did. One of them took a gun and shot Lennox. He shot him very carefully, so that the bullet did not go into Lennox. It gave him a nasty wound but it did not kill him. The idea was to fool the lawyer that would come down. So when he came, Lennox was drugged and packed in ice and the lawyer saw him in a dark room. The fingerprints were real enough but Lennox wasn\'t dead. The Americans paid the Mexican policeman, of course. They must have paid a few people. Isn\'t all this possible?\' Maioranos seemed to be thinking it over. \'Possible, yes. Policemen everywhere have to eat. Otatoclan is far away from the cities and no one asks too many questions there. It is all possible except for one thing, Senor.\' \'What\'s that?\' \'If it is true, then I am a liar. Then I did not go in and give him his coffee and take his letter.\' \'You were already in there, pal - writing the letter.\' The tall Mexican took off his sunglasses. Nothing can change the colour of a man\'s eyes. \'I suppose it\'s a bit too early for a gin and lime,\' he said. They had done a wonderful job on him in Mexico. Why not? Their doctors, painters, architects, are as good as ours, sometimes better. They had changed his nose. They couldn\'t take the scar off, so they gave him another, on the other cheek. Knife scars are not uncommon south of the border. \'How close did I come?\' I asked. \'Close enough. A few details wrong, but they are not important. We had to work very quickly. I was supposed to be followed to Otatoclan of course. Mendy didn\'t want me to write you, but I insisted.\' \'You knew who killed Sylvia?\' He didn\'t give me a straight answer. \'It\'s tough to let a woman be arrested for murder ? even if you never really loved her.\' \'It\'s a tough world,\' I said. \'Was Potter in this with you?\' He smiled. \'I don\'t think so. I\'m not sure, but I think he believes I\'m dead. Who would tell him otherwise ? unless you did?\' \'Don\'t worry. We don\'t have tea together any more. Have you heard that the police have Mendy?\' He smiled again. \'They had him. He\'s in Mexico now. He\'s not as bad as you think. He has a heart.\' \'So does a snake.\' \'How about that gin and lime?\' I got up without answering him and went to my safe. I opened it and took out the five-thousand-dollar bill. I put it on the desk in front of him. \'I enjoyed playing with it. But it\'s yours now.\' He looked at it but he didn\'t touch it. \'I\'ve got plenty of money,\' he said. \'You could have left things alone.\' \'I know. After she had killed her husband she might have done more wonderful things. He was nothing special, anyway. Just a man. He knew what happened, too, and he tried hard to live with it. He wrote books. You may have heard of him.\' \'I didn\'t want anyone to get hurt. I was frightened and I ran. If I\'d stayed, I wouldn\'t have had a chance. What should I have done?\' \'I don\'t know.\' \'She was crazy. She might have killed him anyway.\' I agreed that she might. He smiled, thinking that fixed things between us. \'So let\'s go have a drink. Let\'s go to Victor\'s.\' \'No time right now, Senor Maioranos.\' \'We were good friends once, weren\'t we?\' he asked unhappily. \'Were we? I forget. It seems to me it was two other guys who were friends,\' I said quietly. \'Take back your money. It has too much blood on it.\' \'You need the money.\' \'How would you know?\' He picked the bill up and put it in his pocket. He bit his lower lip with the very white teeth you can have when you have brown skin. \'You remember I gave you a chance to call the police, to have me stopped, don\'t you?\' he said suddenly. \'I\'m not sore at you,\' I said. \'You\'re just that kind of guy. For a long time I tried to understand you. You had good qualities but there was something wrong. You made your own rules. You were a nice guy but that was just luck, I think. You liked your gangsters as much as you liked honest men. Maybe the war did it to you but maybe you were born that way.\' \'Don\'t you understand?\' he said sadly. \'I couldn\'t have told you more than I did. You wouldn\'t have stood for it.\' \'That\'s as nice a thing as was ever said to me.\' \'You call them gangsters. I was in trouble, and they know about trouble. They owed me for the one right thing I did in my life. When I needed them, they were there. And for free. You\'re not the only one in the world who can\'t be bought, Marlowe.\' He took one of my cigarettes and had a little trouble lighting it. \'I can be bought, Terry. You bought a lot of me. For a smile and a nod and a few drinks in quiet bars here and there. It was nice while it lasted. So long, pal. I won\'t say goodbye. I said it to you when it meant something, when it was sad and lonely and final.\' \'I came back too late,\' he said. \'The doctors took a long time on my face.\' \'You wouldn\'t have come at all if I hadn\'t been asking some difficult questions.\' I saw tears in his eyes. He put his green glasses back on quickly. \'They didn\'t want me to tell you anything.\' \'I\'m not judging you, Terry. I never did. You\'re a nice guy in many ways. It\'s just that you\'re not here any more. You\'ve been gone for a long time. You\'ve got nice clothes and you smell nice and you have a pretty litte moustache.\' \'That\'s just an act,\' he said almost desperately. \'But you like it.\' \'An act is all there is. There isn\'t anything eke. I\'m hollow inside. I\'ve had it, Marlowe. I had it long ago. Well ? I guess that\'s all we have to say.\' He put his hand out. I shook it. \'So long, Senor Maioranos.\' He said, \'Goodbye,\' and walked out. I watched the door close. I listened to his footsteps. Did I want him to stop, to come back, to make me change the way I felt? Well, he didn\'t. That was the last time I saw him. I never saw any of them again ? except the cops. No way has yet been invented to say goodbye to them. - THE END -', 1, 1, 0, '', 30934, 11701),

I’d frequently glimpse old women leaning out of their windows, watching people pass below, or families on their evening strolls, stopping every so often to greet friends. Even office life proved different. Forget the rushed desk-side sandwich. Come lunchtime, restaurants filled up with professionals tucking into proper meals. The apparent belief in balancing hard work with il dolce far niente, the sweetness of doing nothing, always struck me. After all, doing nothing appears to be the opposite of being productive. And productivity, whether creative, intellectual or industrial, is the ultimate use of our time. But as we fill our days with more and more ‘doing’, many of us are finding that non-stop activity isn’t the apotheosis of productivity. It is its adversary. Researchers are learning that it doesn’t just mean that the work we produce at the end of a 14-hour day is of worse quality than when we’re fresh. This pattern of working also undermines our creativity and our cognition. Over time, it can make us feel physically sick – and even, ironically, as if we have no purpose. That isn’t easy for those of us who feel like we have to constantly ‘do’. But in order to do more, it seems, we may have to become comfortable with doing less.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 30962, 2),

They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his cigar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to explain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little island of black coral.\n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n‘What should we do?’\n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n‘But here, why does it come here’\nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love something more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bottom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was nothing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been calling to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.\n', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 30834, 11701),

The ghostly pirates on the black ship can never leave it because the ship carries a curse.\nBut this is only a story. There aren\'t really any ghosts. Or are there?\n***\nThe Dauntless sailed slowly through the thick fog. It was a big ship, and it carried fifty guns and a hundred strong men.\nTwelve-year-old Elizabeth Swann stood at the front of the ship. She was on her way to Port Royal in Jamaica. Her father was the new governor there.\n\"I\'d like to meet a pirate,\" she thought. She remembered an old song:\n\"Yo ho, уо ho, a pirate\'s life for me,\nYo ho, yo ho, a pirate\'s life...\"\nSuddenly, a sailor called to her.\n\"Quiet, Miss!\" he said. \"Pirates sail this ocean. You don\'t want to call them to us.\"\n\"Mr. Gibbs!\" Captain Norrington shouted at the old sailor. \"Don\'t be afraid,\" he said to Elizabeth. \"There aren\'t any pirates here today.\"\n\"I\'m not afraid,\" said Elizabeth.\nBut she knew the stories about pirates and fog.\nThey looked down at the dark water. There was something there. What was it? Wood? A box?\n\"Look!\" Elizabeth shouted to the captain.\n\"It\'s a man!\" said Captain Norrington.\n\"No, it\'s not,\" said Elizabeth. \"It\'s a boy. Quickly, quickly, help him! Somebody help him!\"\nCaptain Norrington called to his men.\n\"Get him out!\"\nThe men pulled the boy onto the Dauntless.\n\"Is he OK?\" asked Elizabeth.\n\"Oh, yes, Miss,\" said one of the sailors. \"He\'s fine.\"\n\"But where did he come from?\" asked Elizabeth. \"There\'s nothing out there. Only the ocean.\"\nNobody spoke. And then a big ship came out of the fog. Every man on it was dead.\nThe men ran to the side of the Dauntless and looked down at the water. Were there any more people there?\n\"Miss, you stay with the boy,\" the captain said to Elizabeth.\nElizabeth sat down next to the boy. He was about the same age as her - ten or maybe eleven. Slowly, his eyes opened.\n\"Hello,\" said Elizabeth. \"My name is Elizabeth Swann.\"\n\"I\'m Will. Will Turner.\"\nAnd then he was asleep again.\nElizabeth watched him. Then she saw something inside his shirt.\nSomething gold. Slowly, she took it from him. She looked at it carefully. It was a medallion and there, on the front, was a skull and crossbones!\n\"Oh!\" she thought. \"Will Turner, you\'re... a pirate!\"\nWhen Captain Norrington came back, she quickly put the medallion under her dress.\n\"Did he speak?\" he asked.\n\"His name is Will Turner,\" she answered.\nInside her dress, she felt the gold medallion.\nShe looked out at the ocean - and there, in front of her, was a big, black ship. And it had the skull and crossbones, too!\nThe black ship turned away. But Elizabeth was suddenly very afraid.\n \nChapter two\nPort Royal\nElizabeth opened her eyes. She was in bed, in the Governor\'s House in Port Royal.\nShe looked at the gold medallion and smiled. Every day she thought about the medallion. And every day she thought about Will Turner. Was it really eight years? She heard her father. \"Are you in bed? Get up now!\" Governor Swann came into the room.\n\"It\'s a beautiful day,\" he said. \"And look - I have something for you!\"\nHe gave Elizabeth a box. Inside, there was a beautiful new dress from London.\n\"You can wear it today,\" he said, \"for Captain Norrington\'s party.\" \"Oh, him,\" said Elizabeth.\n\"He\'s a good man. And he likes you, you know. He likes you very much. And after today, he will be a commodore.\"\nThe governor left the bedroom and went back to his office.\nWill Turner was there. He was now twenty years old and a big, strong young man.\n\"Mr. Turner,\" said the governor. \"Good day\"\n\"Good day,\" said Will.\n\"Do you have it?\"\n\"Yes, sir. Here it is.\"\nHe gave the governor a long box. The governor opened it carefully. He took out a sword and smiled.\n\"Ah, very good! A fine job!\"\nHe wanted to give the sword to the new Commodore Norrington.\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Will said.\nWill looked up and saw Elizabeth. She looked beautiful in her new dress.\n\"Ah, Elizabeth!\" the governor said. \"A wonderful dress!\"\nBut Elizabeth\'s eyes were on Will.\n\"Hello, Will,\" she said. \"I thought of you last night. Do you remember that first day, on the ship?\"\n\"Of course I remember, Miss Swann,\" said Will. \"I can never forget that day.\"\nHe smiled at her.\nThe governor wasn\'t happy with this conversation.\n\"We have to go,\" he said to Elizabeth. \"It\'s time.\"\nHe took Elizabeth\'s arm. Elizabeth smiled at Will.\n\"Goodbye, Mr. Turner,\" she said.\nThe governor and his daughter left the house and went out into the busy street.\n \nChapter three\nCaptain Jack Sparrow\nCaptain Jack Sparrow looked at the ships in Port Royal. His boat was small and old. He wanted a new, bigger ship. He had no money, but that wasn\'t a problem. Jack Sparrow was a pirate, and he had a plan.\nHe looked at the Dauntless for a long time. It was a big ship with fifty guns. Then he saw the Interceptor. It was smaller, but faster.\nHe wanted it.\nThere were two sailors next to the Interceptor. Jack went to them.\n\"Hey, you can\'t come here,\" one of them said. He looked at Jack\'s old boat and laughed. \"Who are you? And what\'s that?\"\n\"That\'s my boat,\" said Jack.\nHe smiled at the man and looked carefully at the Interceptor.\nThe man smiled back.\n\"I like your ship,\" Jack said.\n\"Yes, it\'s the fastest ship in the Caribbean.\"\n\"Really?\" said Jack. \"Isn\'t the Black Pearl the fastest ship?\"\nThe sailor laughed. \"Ghost stories are for children,\" he said.\n\"It isn\'t a story,\" said the other sailor to his friend. \"I saw that ship.\"\nHe turned to Jack - but Jack wasn\'t there. He was on the Interceptor.\nThe sailors ran after him.\n\"What are you doing?\" they shouted. \"You can\'t go up there! What\'s your name?\"\n\"Smith,\" Jack answered.\n\"And what are you doing in Port Royal, Mr. Smith?\"\n\"I want one of these ships,\" Jack said.\nThe sailors thought about this.\n***\nHigh above the harbor, Elizabeth stood with Commodore Norrington. It was a hot day, and her dress was very heavy.\n\"Look at the ships down in the harbor,\" she said. \"They\'re beautiful.\"\n\"And you are more beautiful,\" said Commodore Norrington. \"You\'re a fine woman.\" Elizabeth didn\'t say anything. \"I hope...\" he said. \"I hope that one day you will marry me, Elizabeth.\"\n\"Marry?\" Elizabeth said. \"Marry you?\"\nShe moved back, but she couldn\'t move easily in her new dress. Suddenly, she fell.\nShe fell down, down into the harbor below.\nOn the Interceptor, Jack and the two sailors saw everything. The sailors didn\'t move.\n\"Quick!\" Jack said to them. \"Aren\'t you going to help her?\"\n\"But we can\'t swim!\"\n\"Here,\" said Jack. \"Take these and don\'t lose them!\"\nHe gave them his hat and his gun.\nJack jumped into the water and swam to Elizabeth. She was under the water. He took her hand and tried to help her. But her dress was too heavy!\nJack found his knife and cut the dress off. Then he pulled the young woman out.\nCommodore Norrington and Governor Swann ran down to the harbor.\n\"Thank you! Thank you!\" said the governor. \"Elizabeth, my dearest daughter, are you OK?\"\n\"Yes, yes, I\'m fine,\" said Elizabeth.\nShe sat up.\nNorrington looked at Jack.\n\"Good man!\" he said. \"Thank you! Give me your hand.\"\nThen he saw it - a white P on Jack\'s hand. \"I know you,\" he said. \"You\'re a pirate!\" He looked at Jack carefully. \"Your name is Jack Sparrow.\"\n\"Captain Jack Sparrow, please,\" said Jack.\n\"I don\'t see your ship... captain,\" said Norrington. \"And you\'re a pirate.\"\n\"He wanted to take one of our ships.\" The sailors from the Interceptor were with them now.\nNorrington looked at Jack and laughed. Then he turned to the sailors.\n\"Take him away!\" he said. \"Put him in chains. Now!\" The sailors put chains on Jack.\n\"You can\'t do that!\" said Elizabeth. \"Maybe he is a pirate, but he helped me.\"\nSuddenly, Jack moved. He jumped behind Elizabeth and put his chains around her. The sailors showed their guns.\n\"No, no, don\'t shoot!\" shouted Norrington. \"Be careful! He\'ll kill her.\" Jack pulled Elizabeth back. \"I really don\'t like you,\" Elizabeth said to him.\n\"I helped you and now you\'re helping me,\" Jack said. He smiled. Then, suddenly, he took the chains off Elizabeth and ran.\n\"Get him!\" shouted Norrington. \"Get him, now!\"\n', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 35507, 11701),

(35697, 'The Fog Horn by Ray Bradbury\n\nEvery night MacDunn and Johnny waited for the fog. When it came, they lit the fog light in the lighthouse. Red, then white, then red again. They sent the light to the ships out in the sea but when the fog was too thick they switched on their Fog Horn!\nOne cold November evening they were having a quiet talk about their job, about the mysteries of the sea. The great eye of the light was shining into the sea. The Fog Horn was blowing once every fifteen seconds.\n‘One night,’ said MacDunn, ‘years ago, I was here alone. Suddenly the fish came up. Something made them swim up. When I saw their funny eyes, I turned cold. They were like a big peacock’s tail in the moonlight.\nThen, without a sound, they disappeared. Strange. Think how the lighthouse must look to them. It stands high above the water, the light comes out from it, and the tower speaks in a monster voice…’\nJohnny was frightened. He was watching the grey sea going away into nothing and nowhere.\n‘Oh, the sea’s full of life,’ he said.\n‘Yes, it’s an old world,’ MacDunn smoked his cigar and looked worried. ‘Now, I’ve got something to tell you. The Fog Horn sounds like an animal, doesn’t it? A big lonely animal crying in the night. Calling out to the Deep, ‘I’m here, I’m here.’ Well, you have been here for three months, Johnny, so I’m going to tell you. Something comes to visit the lighthouse.’\n‘Do you mean the fish?’\n‘No, something else. First it happened three years ago. It usually happens about this time of the year. Let’s wait and watch.’\nWhile they were waiting, MacDunn told some theories about the Fog Horn to Johnny.\n‘One day a man walked along the cold shore. Then he stopped and said, «We need a voice to call across the water to the ships. I’ll make one like a voice of the fog. I’ll make a sound that’s so lonely that everybody listens to it. Everyone who hears it will start crying, and their hearts will become warmer.» I made up that story to explain why it keeps coming back to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn calls it, I think, and it comes…’\nIt was a foggy night and the light was coming and going, and the Fog Horn was calling through the air. In the high tower they watched the sea moving to the dark shore. And then, suddenly from the cold sea came a large dark head, and then a neck. And then more neck and more! The head was high above the water on a beautiful dark neck. Finally came the body, like a little island of black coral.\n‘It’s impossible!’ said Johnny.\n‘No, Johnny, we’re impossible. It has always been. It hasn’t changed at all!’\nThe silent monster was swimming slowly in the icy water with the fog around. One of its eyes caught the bright light of the tower, red, white, red, white.\n‘But the dinosaurs died out long ago!’ Johnny cried.\n‘No, they hid away in the Deep.’\n‘What should we do?’\n‘We’ve got our job. We can’t leave it. Besides, we’re safe here.’\n‘But here, why does it come here’\nThe next moment Johnny had his answer. The Fog Horn blew. And the monster answered. A cry so sad and lonely! The Fog Horn blew. The monster cried again. The Fog Horn blew. The monster opened its great toothed mouth and the sound that came from it was the sound of the Fog Horn itself. It was the sound of unhappiness, of a cold night.\n‘Imagine, all year long,’ whispered MacDunn, ‘that poor monster waits, deep in the sea. Maybe it’s the last of its kind. Think of it, waiting a million years! One day it hears the Fog Horn in his deep hiding-place. The sound comes and goes, comes and goes. Then the monster starts its way up to have a look at it. He does it very slowly because the heavy ocean is on its shoulders. It goes up and up for three autumn months and it can hear the voice better and better. And there it is, in the night, Johnny! And here’s the lighthouse. The monster can see that the lighthouse has got a neck as long as its neck, and a body like its body, and, most important of all, a voice like its voice. Do you understand now, Johnny?’\nThe Fog Horn blew. The monster answered. It was only a hundred yards off now.\n‘That’s how it happens,’ said MacDunn. ‘You love something more than that thing loves you. And one day you want to destroy it, because it hurts you.’\nThe monster was swimming to the lighthouse. The Fog Horn blew.\n‘Let’s see what happens,’ said MacDunn and switched the Fog Horn off.\nIt was a minute of silence and the men could hear their hearts. The monster’s eyes looked into the dark. Its mouth opened. It sounded like a volcano. It turned its head to the right and then to the left. It looked for the Fog Horn, for its deep sounds. Then its eyes caught fire. It swam towards the tower, its eyes filled with anger.\n‘MacDunn!’ Johnny cried. ‘Switch on the horn!’\nMacDunn switched the horn on and they saw its fish skin. It hit the tower with its gigantic paws and the tower shook.\nMacDunn cried, ‘Downstairs! Quick!’\nThey ran down and hid in a small room at the bottom of the lighthouse. The next moment they heard the rocks raining down. The lighthouse fell. There was nothing but darkness and the wash of the sea on the stones. And then they heard the monster’s cry. There was no tower and no Fog Horn — the thing that had been calling to the monster for so many years. And the monster was opening its mouth and sending out great sounds. The sounds of a Fog Horn, again and again. And so it went for the rest of that night.\nThe next morning the people came and helped them to get out of the ruins.\n‘It was a terrible storm,’ said Mr. MacDunn. ‘We had some bad knocks from the waves and the tower fell.’\nThe ocean was quiet and the sky was blue. The lighthouse was in the ruins. The monster? It never came back. It returned back to the Deep. It learned you can’t love anything too much in this world.\n\n\n', 1, 1, 0, NULL, 35696, 11701),

He couldn\'t hear the sailors. He was free! But he had the chains on his hands.\nHe saw a store and opened the doors. Then he went in, very carefully. It was dark, but he could see some swords and knives.\n\"Ah, a blacksmith\'s store,\" he thought. \"I can use one of those knives.\"\nHe took one and started to cut the chains. It was hard work, and it hurt his hands. But after a minute or two the chains fell to the floor.\nSuddenly, Jack heard a sound behind him. It was Will Turner.\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked Will. He looked at Jack. \"Oh, you\'re the pirate. People are looking for you.\"\nHe took a sword.\n\"Is that a good idea?\" asked Jack.\nWill didn\'t speak. He put up his sword and looked at Jack.\nThey fought. Jack was quick, but Will was quick, too.\n\"You can use a sword!\" said Jack.\nHe turned and ran to the door. But Will was too quick for him. He threw his sword at the door. It went over Jack\'s head. Jack tried to pull it out, but he couldn\'t. And now he couldn\'t open the door.\nHe turned to Will and smiled.\n\"That was good,\" he said. He looked at the other door to the store. \"But you\'re between me and that door. And now you have no sword!\"\nWill took another sword and they fought again.\n \n\"Do you make these swords?\" Jack asked.\n\"Yes, and I use them for three hours a day after work, too,\" Will answered.\n\"Why don\'t you find a girl? It\'s more exciting,\" Jack said. He took out a gun. \"Now, move away from the door,\" he said.\nBehind Jack, Will saw his boss, Mr. Brown. In Mr. Brown\'s hand there was a bottle. Slowly, the blacksmith moved his arm up. And then he hit Jack on the head - hard.\nJack fell to the ground.\nNorrington arrived with his sailors. He looked down at Jack.\n\"Good work, Mr. Brown. Remember this day. On this day Captain Jack Sparrow almost got away!\"\nMr. Brown looked at the glass on the ground.\n\"He broke my bottle!\" he said.\n\nChapter five\nPirates in Town\nIt was night, and there was a thick fog in Port Royal. Through the fog came a ship - a tall, black ship. It carried the skull and crossbones.\nIn her bed in the Governor\'s House, Elizabeth tried to read. She couldn\'t sleep. She saw the fog, and she thought about the pirates and the ghost story.\nDown in the town, Will left the store and stood in the street. Everything was quiet - too quiet.\nIn his cell, Jack sat and thought. What could he do? How could he get out of this place? He looked out at the harbor and at the fog, but he wasn\'t afraid.\nSuddenly, there was a loud noise from guns.\n\"I know those guns,\" Jack thought. \"It\'s the Pearl!\"\nHe heard the guns again. And again. Jack looked down at the town. It was on fire! Smoke came from the houses and the stores. People ran out into the streets.\nAnd then, out of the smoke and the fog, the pirates came. They ran through the town, with their guns and their swords and their knives. They started more fires, and carried things away from the houses.\nWill ran back into the store and took a sword and a knife. Then he went outside again.\n\"Elizabeth,\" he thought. \"I have to help Elizabeth.\"\nHe started to run to the governor\'s house. But he didn\'t see the man behind him. The pirate hit him, hard, on the head, and Will fell to the ground.\nUpstairs in her room, Elizabeth looked out her window and saw the fire and the smoke in the town. Then she looked down and saw two pirates at the door of the house. What could she do? Where could she go?\nOne of the pirates looked up. Ragetti was very dirty, and he only had one good eye. With it, he saw Elizabeth.\n\"Look, Pintel,\" he said. \"Up there!\" Pintel looked up and smiled.\nThe pirates ran up the stairs. Elizabeth was afraid and quickly closed her bedroom door. The pirates hit the door, again and again. After some time, they broke the door and went into the room. But they couldn\'t see Elizabeth. Suddenly, Elizabeth ran past them and out of the room. She ran down the stairs and into the dining-room. The pirates ran after her. She looked for a gun, for a sword, but there was nothing there. She heard the pirates on the stairs. Where could she go?\nThere was a small closet at the back of the room. She went in and closed the door, very quietly. The pirates came into the room.\n\"Come out, little girl,\" called Pintel. \"You have something, and we want it.\"\n\"The gold is calling to us,\" said Ragetti. \"Come out.\" In the closet, Elizabeth didn\'t move. She had the gold medallion in her hand.\nAnd then, suddenly, the door opened, and there was Ragetti. His one eye looked at her. \"Hello, little girl...\"\n \nChapter six\nOn the Black Pearl\nThe pirates took Elizabeth to the Black Pearl in a small boat. When they climbed out, a man came out of the fog.\n\"Good day,\" he said to Elizabeth. \"My name is Barbossa. I\'m the captain of the Black Pearl.\"\nElizabeth looked around her. There were pirates everywhere. She was afraid, but she didn\'t show it.\n\"I am Elizabeth Turner.\" She didn\'t want to use her name. \"I want you to leave Port Royal,\" she said. \"Leave and never come back.\"\nThe pirates laughed.\n\"I\'m sorry,\" said Barbossa. \"But that isn\'t possible. We\'re looking for...\"\n\"I know!\" shouted Elizabeth. She ran to the side of the boat and then showed them the gold medallion. \"You\'re looking for this! Come near me and I\'ll throw it in the water.\"\nThe pirates didn\'t speak. Their eyes were on the medallion.\n\"I know you want it,\" said Elizabeth. \"I know this ship. After eight years, I remember it. Now go and never come back!\"\nThe pirates watched her, carefully. Elizabeth tried again. With the medallion in her hand, she looked down at the water.\n\"I\'ll throw it away now...\"\n\"OK, OK,\" said Barbossa. \"You win. Give me the medallion, and we\'ll leave.\"\nElizabeth gave him the gold medallion.\n\"Stop the guns!\" shouted Barbossa. \"We\'re leaving.\" He looked at Elizabeth. \"And, Miss Turner, you\'re going to come with us.\"\n\"But you have to take me back!\" Elizabeth said.\n\"No,\" said the pirate, and he smiled. \"I stopped the guns, and we\'re going.

He ran to the governor\'s office. He found the governor, Norrington, and the two sailors. \"The pirates have Elizabeth!\" he shouted. Norrington looked at him.\n\"Mr. Turner,\" he said. \"You\'re a blacksmith. This isn\'t your fight. Please go.\" \"We have to find her,\" Will said. \"Of course we do,\" Norrington said. \"And we will.\" \"Jack Sparrow!\" said one of the sailors. \"He knows about the Black Pearl.\"\n\"Go to Sparrow.

Do you know the pirate ship - the Black Pearl?\" \"Yes...\" said Jack. \"Where does it go?\"\n\"It sails from the Isla de Muerta - the Island of the Dead. You know the stories. But why ask me?\" \"They took Miss Swann,\" said Will angrily. The pirate smiled.\n\"Oh, so you did find a girl...\" he said. \"But what can I do? I\'m in here.\"\n\"I can help you,\" said Will. \"I can get you out of here, and then you can help me!\"\nJack Sparrow thought about this.\n\"Whats your name, boy?\" he asked.\n\"Turner.

You\'re crazy!\"\nBut Will followed Jack. The two men swam to the ship and climbed up the side. There were sailors on the ship.\n\"Don\'t move!\" Jack told them. \"I have a gun! I want this ship.\"\nThe sailors looked at Jack, then at Will. They started to laugh,\n\"But this is a big ship,\" one of them said. \"You can\'t sail it with two men!\"\n\"We can try,\" said Jack. \"Now, leave!\"\nThe sailors looked at Jack and Will. They looked at the gun. And then they got into a small boat and left the Dauntless.\nFrom the Interceptor, Norrington saw Will and Jack on the Dauntless.\n\"What?\" he thought. \"You? But how...? And where are you going on my ship?\"\nHe turned to his sailors.\n\"Quickly,\" he said. \"We have to catch the Dauntless. Now!\"\nThe Interceptor was a faster ship, and minutes later it was near the Dauntless.\n\"Let\'s take them!\" shouted Norrington.\nHe and his men went onto the Dauntless. Only one man stayed on the Interceptor.\nNorrington\'s men looked everywhere.\n\"Find them! I know they\'re here!\" the captain shouted. But Jack and Will weren\'t on the Dauntless. They were now on the Interceptor. \"Hello,\" said Jack to the only sailor there.\nThe man looked at him. He looked at Jack\'s sword. And he looked at Jacks gun. \"Can you swim?\" asked Jack. \"Like a fish,\" said the sailor. \"Good!\" said Jack and threw him in the water. Commodore Norrington and his men saw the sailor when he fell.\n\"Stop them!\" Norrington shouted. \"Stop them!\"\nBut it was too late. The Interceptor sailed out of the harbor.\n \nChapter eight\nDinner with Barbossa\nElizabeth sat at a table on the Black Pearl. There was a lot of food on the table - bread, fruit, and meat. Captain Barbossa sat at the other end of the table.\n\"Are you hungry?\" he said. \"Please eat.\"\nElizabeth was very hungry. She took some bread and some meat and started to eat.\n\"Have a drink,\" said Barbossa.\nElizabeth drank. Then she looked at the captain.\n\"You\'re not eating!\" she said. \"Is something wrong with the food? Are you trying to kill me? You eat it!\"\nShe gave the captain some bread, but he didn\'t take it.\n\"I can\'t eat it,\" Barbossa said unhappily. \"I\'d like to. I\'d love to. But I can\'t.\"\nHe took the gold medallion from his coat.\n\"This gold, Miss Turner, is very old. The Aztecs gave it to Cortes when he arrived in the Americas. There are many, many more of these. And the Aztecs put a curse on them.\n\"We found the gold on the Isla de Muerta,\" said Barbossa. \"We took all of it. We bought food and drink with it. But then, suddenly, we couldn\'t eat and we couldn\'t drink. When we took the money, Miss Turner, the curse came with it.\"\nThe captain suddenly looked happier. \"But now we can end the curse. We had to find all of the gold. Then we had to put it back on the island and give some blood. For ten years we looked for the gold on every ship and in every town...\"\n\"And now you have all of it,\" Elizabeth said.\n\"Yes. With this gold medallion, we have all of it. Thank you.\"\nShe thought for a minute.\n\"You have everything, and you\'re going to be free of the curse. So why am I here?\"\n\"There\'s one more thing. You\'re Elizabeth Turner, the daughter of the pirate Bill Turner. He was one of us, but he isn\'t with us now. We have to have your blood!\"\nElizabeth didn\'t understand, but she was afraid. Her blood?\nShe jumped up and tried to run. But Barbossa stood in front of her. She took a knife and pushed it into him. Then she ran outside. She closed her eyes. Her blood! What could she do?\nShe opened her eyes and saw the pirates at work. Then she looked carefully. They weren\'t men - they were skeletons!\nBarbossa was behind her.\n\"Now, Miss Turner, you can really see us.\" He smiled. \"Yes, Miss Turner, we\'re all ghosts. You\'re in a ghost story!\"\n\nChapter nine\nThe Island of Tortuga\nWill helped Jack on the Interceptor. The weather was good, and the wind was strong.\n\"You\'re not a sailor,\" said Jack. \"You\'re a blacksmith. Where did you learn about sailing?\"\n\"I worked on a ship when I was a boy,\" said Will. \"I came from England. I wanted to find my father - Bill Turner.\"\n\"Is that right?\"\n\"You knew my father,\" said Will. \"I asked for your help when you were in the cell. You weren\'t interested. But when you heard my name, you said yes.\"\n\"Oh, I knew him,\" said Jack. \"Everybody knew Bill. He was a good man. He was... a good pirate.\"\n\"No!\" shouted Will. \"You\'re wrong. My father wasn\'t a pirate.\"\nHe pulled out his sword.\n\"Put that away,\" Jack told him. \"Why are you getting excited? Your father was a pirate, Mr. Turner. A good man, but a pirate. Now help me with this ship.\"\nThey arrived at the island of Tortuga.\nTortuga was a small, dirty place. It had a harbor, some houses, an old store, and four bars. Bad men and pirates went there. They wanted to drink and to find women.\n\"Come with me,\" Jack said to Will. \"We have to find some sailors for our ship.\"\nThey went into a bar and found an old man. His name was Joshaemee Gibbs. He was asleep, and he had a bottle in his hand. Jack kicked him.\n\"Wake up, Mr. Gibbs. We have work for you.\"\nSlowly, Gibbs opened his eyes. \"Oh, it\'s you. What do you want?\"\nJack moved near to the old man. He didn\'t want Will to hear their conversation.\n\"We\'re looking for a ship,\" he said. \"The Black Pearl.\"\n\"The Black Pearl?\" The old man sat up. \"That\'s not smart, Jack Sparrow. You know the stories about the Black Pearl. Do you think Barbossa is going to give you his ship?\"\nJack laughed. \"Oh, I think he will,\" he answered. He looked at Will, and the old man\'s eyes followed his. \"I have the boy and they want him.\"\n\"That boy?\"\n\"The child of Bill Turner. His only child.\"\nJoshaemee Gibbs didn\'t speak. He thought about Jack\'s words. And then he smiled.\n\"Ah, I understand,\" he said. \"His only child. I think I can find some sailors for you now.\"\nGibbs did his job well. Some of the sailors were small; some were tall. Some were fat; some were thin. Some were smart; some were stupid. But they were all good sailors. They stood in front of their captain.\nJack looked at them. Then he showed them the ship.\n\"There\'s my ship, the Interceptor,\" he said. \"It is a fine ship, a fast ship. Sail with me, and at the end you can have it! What do you say?\"\nThe sailors shouted, \"Yes!\"\nJack stopped in front of a sailor in a very big hat. Suddenly a hand came out from under the hat and hit him. Jack fell to the ground. The hat fell, too - and showed a woman\'s face.\nJack stood up.\n\"Hello, AnaMaria,\" he said.\n\"You took my boat!\" she shouted.\n\"Ah...\" said Jack slowly.\n\"And where is it now? Do you have it?\"\n\"No, I don\'t. But this ship is better.\" He turned to the men. \"Get ready!\" he said. \"We\'re going to sail. And AnaMaria will give you your work.\"\nThe sailors ran onto the ship, and the Interceptor left Tortuga.\nGibbs and Will sat and looked out at the ocean.\n\"Do you know Captain Sparrow well?\" Will asked.\n\"Oh yes,\" said Gibbs. \"I knew him when he was captain of the Black Pearl.\"\n\"What? Captain of the Black Pearl? But how...?\" \"Listen to the story,\" said Gibbs. \"Jack Sparrow was a pirate, but he was a good man. He found the Isla de Muerta - and there was gold for every sailor on his ship. But his sailors didn\'t want Jack Sparrow. They wanted the gold. So they left him on an island with no food and no water - only his gun.\" \"They left him?\"\n\"They left him - but he got away. And now he wants to find those pirates, and he wants to use that gun. He wants to shoot their captain, Barbossa!\"\n \n***\nThe Black Pearl was at the Isla de Muerta. \"It\'s time, my dear,\" said Ragetti.\nHe smiled at her, but his one good eye watched her carefully. They put her in a small boat and left the Black Pearl. The fog got thinner. Elizabeth could see a big, black cave. \"Are we going in there?\" she asked. \"Yes, my dear,\" said Pintel.\n', 1, 1, 0, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl', 35927, 11701),

(36044, '\nThe Curse of the Black Pearl\n\nChapter ten\n\nGold!\nA short time later, Will and Jack and their men arrived at the Isla de Muerta, too. Through the fog, they could see ships - old ships under the water. Jack turned to Gibbs. \"Stay here with the men,\" he said. Jack and Will got into a smaller boat and started to go to the island.\n\"Do you see that?\" said Will. \"There! A cave, I think.\" The boat moved slowly into the cave. It was very dark, and the walls were wet. Jack and Will didn\'t speak. On their left, they saw a light, and next to it was a skeleton. It had a sword in its back.\nThey stopped the boat and jumped out. Then Will followed Jack, and they climbed for a short time.\nSuddenly, they saw some lights. In front of them was a second, bigger cave. They saw gold boxes, gold cups, gold plates, and gold swords. And a lot of money. The cave was full of gold!\nIn the middle of the cave, in the middle of the gold, Elizabeth stood next to an old Aztec box. She couldn\'t move because Barbossa had his hands on her.\nWill wanted to go to her, but Jack stopped him.\n\"No!\" he said. \"We have to wait.\"\nWill didn\'t want to wait. Elizabeth\'s life was too important to him.\n\"I\'m sorry, Jack,\" he said, and he hit Jack hard.\nJack fell to the ground. He didn\'t move.\nWill looked around the cave and listened.\n\"Do you know my plan?\" Captain Barbossa said to his men. \"When this curse ends, I\'m going to eat fruit. A lot of fruit!\"\nThe other pirates laughed.\nBarbossa looked at Elizabeth. He took her hand and cut it with a knife. Then he put the medallion on her hand and closed her hand around it.\n\"Blood,\" he said. \"Turner\'s blood. The curse started with blood and it ends with blood.\"\nHe took the bloody medallion from Elizabeth and put it into the box, onto the gold.\nThe pirates waited.\n\"I don\'t feel different,\" Ragetti said. \"Is that really the end of the curse?\"\n\"How will we know?\" Pintel asked.\nBarbossa thought about that. Then he took out his gun and shot Pintel. Pintel stayed on his feet.\nThe pirates were very unhappy.\n\"Oh, it didn\'t work!\" they shouted.\nBarbossa didn\'t understand.\n\"You!\" he said to Elizabeth. \"Was your father William Turner? Bill Turner?\" \"No,\" she said. The pirates shouted again. \"She\'s not Turner\'s child!\" \"She\'s the wrong person!\" \"But she had the medallion!\" \"She\'s the right age.\" They called to Barbossa. \" You killed Bill.\" \"You started this!\" Nobody looked at Elizabeth. Suddenly, she felt a hand on her arm. It was Will. \"Come with me,\" he said quietly. \"Quickly. Now.\" Elizabeth started to move. But first, she took the medallion. They ran to the boat.\n\"Look, the girl! She has the medallion! Get them!\" The pirates ran to their boats. Then they saw Jack. \"Jack Sparrow!\" said Barbossa. \"Aren\'t you dead?\" \"No, I\'m not dead.\" \"But you will be...\" Barbossa took out his gun.\n\"Wait, wait,\" said Jack. \"The girl\'s blood didn\'t work.\" \"How do you know?\"\n\"I know. You don\'t want her blood. I can help you.\"\n\nChapter eleven\nThe Blood of a Pirate\nWill and Elizabeth arrived at the Interceptor. \"Where\'s Jack?\" asked Gibbs. \"Yes, where\'s Jack?\" asked AnaMaria.\nJack? Jack Sparrow? Elizabeth wasn\'t happy. She didn\'t want the help of a pirate. \"He\'s on the island, \"Will told them. \"We have to go - now.\" \"OK,\" said Gibbs. \"Get ready!\" he shouted to the other sailors. Will and Elizabeth went to the back of the boat. Will looked into Elizabeth\'s eyes. He moved nearer but Elizabeth stopped him. \"This is yours,\" she said. She gave him the gold medallion. \"What\'s this?\" he asked.\n\"Don\'t you remember? You had it when I found you.\" \"Oh yes,\" said Will. He looked at the medallion. \"It was my father\'s.\" And then he understood. \"They have to have my blood - not yours. My father\'s blood. The blood of a pirate!\"\n***\nJack and Barbossa sat at a table on the Black Pearl. \"Ah, my ship,\" Jack said. \"It isn\'t your ship now,\" Barbossa said angrily. \"You give me my ship,\" Jack said, \"and I\'ll give you a name. You\'ll have your blood. And I want to say thank you.\" \"Why?\"\n\"You left me on that island,\" Jack said. \"You took the gold, and the curse went with it. But the curse isn\'t on me. So thank you!\" A pirate came in.\n\"We can see the Interceptor,\" he said. \"Get the guns ready,\" shouted Barbossa.\n\"Why don\'t I go onto the ship and talk to them?\" Jack said. \"I\'ll get your medallion.\"\n\"No, you won\'t.\" Barbossa turned to his sailors. \"Take him downstairs - and watch him!\"\nThe Black Pearl moved faster and faster.\n***\nThe sailors on the Interceptor watched the pirate ship. \"It\'s too fast,\" Gibbs shouted. \"We\'re too heavy,\" said AnaMaria.\nThey threw everything into the water: boxes, bottles, food. But the Black Pearl was very near them now. Then it was at their side.\nThe fight was short, and Barbossa\'s pirates quickly won. They took Elizabeth and Jack\'s sailors onto the Black Pearl. Barbossa had the medallion in his hand. Suddenly, Will was there in front of him! He had a gun. \"She goes free!\" he said. \"Elizabeth goes free.\"\n\"No, she doesn\'t, boy,\" said Barbossa. \"Put down that gun. You can\'t kill me. We\'re ghosts. We can\'t die.\"\n \n\"You can\'t. But I can.\" Will put the gun to his head. \"My name is Will Turner. My father was Bill Turner. His blood is my blood!\" The pirates looked at Will. They didn\'t move. \"Without my blood,\" said Will, \"the curse will always be with you.\" He was right. The pirates knew it. \"OK, Mr. Turner,\" said Barbossa. \"What do you want?\" \"Elizabeth goes free.\" \"Yes. We know that. And?\" Will thought hard. This game was new to him. \"And... and the sailors of the Interceptor.\" \"OK,\" said Barbossa.\nWill put down his gun. Barbossa took it and smiled. \"Jack and the girl will go to that island,\" he said. He showed them a very small island near the boat. \"But they won\'t be free!\" shouted Will. \"You said...\" \"They will be free. But they\'ll be free on that island.\"\n\nChapter twelve\nOn a Small Island\n\"Now,\" Barbossa said to Jack, \"it\'s time for a swim.\" \"Last time you gave me a gun,\" said Jack.\n\"Yes, that\'s right.\" Barbossa turned to his sailors. \"Give him his gun.\"\n\"There are two of us. We want two guns.\" \"Only one. You can shoot the girl with it.\" Barbossa took the gun and threw it into the water. Elizabeth jumped in and Jack followed. They swam to the bottom and got the gun. Then they swam to the island. They looked back at the Black Pearl.\n\"He has my ship again!\" said Jack angrily. \"For the second time!\"\nElizabeth looked around the island. \"It\'s not very big,\" she said.\nJack didn\'t speak. He remembered this island. He sat down and started to make a fire. \"How can we get away?\" asked Elizabeth. \"We can\'t.\"\n\"How long can we live here?\"\n\"Oh, there\'s food on the trees. Maybe a month. Maybe more.\" \"But we don\'t have a month! We have to help Will! We have to do something now!\" Elizabeth sat by the fire and started to sing the old song: \"Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate\'s life for me, Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate\'s life... We drink, we fight, and then we die, Yo ho, yo ho, and we drink to a pirate\'s life.\" \"How do you know that?\" Jack asked. \"Oh, I learned it when I was a child.\" \"I love that song,\" said Jack. He sang with her.\n\"We\'re hard and we\'re bad and we fight and we drink...\" And then he fell asleep.\nElizabeth thought hard. Then she started to work. She got more wood and put it on the fire. Then she found more and more wood. When Jack woke up, there was fire everywhere. \"What are you doing?\" he asked Elizabeth. \"We have to live here!\" \"Look at the smoke,\" Elizabeth said. He looked. There was a lot of smoke.\n\"You see?\" Elizabeth said. \"Everybody is looking for us. And when they see the smoke...\" \"Nobody will see it,\" Jack said. \"They aren\'t looking around here.\" Jack walked down to the water. And then he saw it - a ship! An English ship! It was the Dauntless. \"She\'s never going to forget this,\" he thought.\n', 1, 1, 0, 'The Curse of the Black Pearl', 36043, 11701),

And again, Commodore Norrington wanted to put him in chains.\n\"Mr. Norrington!\" Elizabeth said. \"We have to go to the Isla de Muerta. Captain Sparrow can help us, but not in chains.\"\n\"Commodore Norrington,\" said Jack, \"Barbossa is the captain of the last pirate ship in the Caribbean. You have to catch him. But without me, how can you find him?\" Norrington thought about this.\n\"We have to go back to Port Royal,\" he said. \"The governor wants to take his daughter home. We can\'t go after pirates.\"\n\"Please, please,\" said Elizabeth. \"Will is on the Isla de Muerta. We have to help him.\"\n\"Do we?\"\n\"Mr. Norrington, you want to marry me. We can marry. We will marry. But first, we have to help Will. Please do it for me.\" Norrington smiled. Then he turned to his sailors.\n\"OK, men, get ready. We\'re going to the Isla de Muerta\'\n***\nWill and the ghostly pirates were in the cave on the Isla de Muerta. \"It isn\'t a problem,\" Pintel told Will. \"It\'s only a little blood.\" \"Maybe more than a little,\" said Barbossa. He pushed Will down on the floor and put a knife to his head. \"Excuse me!\"\n\"Who\'s that?\" said Barbossa. \"Who\'s there?\" \"It\'s me. Captain Jack Sparrow.\" Jack walked into the cave. Barbossa looked at him.\n\"Not you again!\" he said. \"How did you get off the island?\" Jack laughed, and Barbossa got angry.\n\"First Turner, then you,\" he said to Jack. \"I want to see you die.\" \"No,\" said Jack, very slowly. \"You don\'t want to do that.\" \"And why not?\"\n\"Because the Dauntless is here. They want to take you.\" Barbossa took the knife away from Will\'s head. \"Take us? They can\'t. We\'re not men, we\'re ghosts.\" \"You\'re ghosts now. But after the blood? When you\'re men again, they can kill you.\" Barbossa thought about this. \"So, what\'s your plan?\" he said.\n\"Go out to the Dauntless now. Ghosts can take the Dauntless. Then you\'ll have two ships.\"\n\"And what do you want?\"\n\"I want to be a captain again. Under you, of course. You\'ll have the Dauntless, and I\'ll be your captain on the Black Pearl.\" Barbossa smiled. \"OK. Let\'s do it!\"\n***\nOutside the cave, Commodore Norrington waited on the water. He had seven small boats and more than fifty men. It was time for a fight!\nBut when the ghostly pirates started to move, Norrington didn\'t see them. They weren\'t in their boats. They walked on the ocean floor, below Norrington and his men. Only the fish saw them.\n\"Where are they?\" said one of the sailors. \"Can anybody see them?\"\nSuddenly, they heard a loud noise. Guns! On the Dauntless! Commodore Norrington turned and looked at his ship. He saw his men. And he saw... skeletons.\n\"Quickly!\" he shouted. \"Back to the ship!\"\nThey went back to the Dauntless and climbed up the side. They shot at the ghostly pirates, but they couldn\'t kill them. Then Norrington saw Governor Swann.\n\"Are you OK, sir?\" he asked.\n\"I\'m OK. But where\'s Elizabeth?\"\n\nChapter fourteen\nThe End of the Curse\nAt the same time, Elizabeth left the Dauntless and swam to the Black Pearl. She climbed up the side and heard pirates. There were only two of them on the ship. They wanted Barbossa to come back. They wanted the end of the curse.\nThe sailors looked at the food on the captain\'s table.\n\"What will you eat first?\" one asked.\n\"Cake. A lot of cake,\" said the other man.\nQuietly, Elizabeth climbed onto the Pearl. But then the pirates saw her.\n\"Hey, you! Stop!\"\nElizabeth ran and the pirates followed. But they stopped when they heard a noise behind them.\n\"What was that?\"\nGibbs was there. Then AnaMaria, and more sailors. They pushed the two pirates, hard, and the pirates fell into the water.\n\"Who are you?\" said Elizabeth.\n\"We\'re Jack Sparrow\'s sailors,\" said one of them. \"And now the Black Pearl is ours!\"\n\"Good!\" said Elizabeth. \"We have to help Will. And Jack, too. Quick! We have to go into the cave.\"\nBut the sailors didn\'t move.\n\"No,\" said AnaMaria. \"The Black Pearl is ours, not Jack Sparrow\'s. He took my boat.\"\n\"OK,\" said Elizabeth. \"Then I\'ll go without you!\"\n***\nIn the cave, Jack, Will, and Barbossa looked at the gold.\n\"I don\'t understand you,\" said Barbossa. \"Are you with them or with us?\"\n\"I\'m a difficult man,\" said Jack. \"Nobody understands me. Here, catch!\" he said to Will, suddenly. He threw a sword from the floor to the young man. \"Jack!\" said Barbossa. \"I almost liked you!\" Jack laughed.\n\"Remember, I am a pirate!\" he said.\nJack fought Barbossa, and Will fought Barbossa\'s men.\nSuddenly, Barbossa stopped.\n\"You can\'t win, Jack,\" he said.\nThen he pushed his sword hard into Jack. It went through him and came out of his back.\nJack stopped fighting. Will stopped fighting. They looked at the end of the sword.\n\"I liked your curse,\" said Jack. \"I wanted some gold, too.\"\nHe pulled a gold medallion from his pants. He was a skeleton, too!\nJack pulled the sword out, and the two skeletons fought again. Barbossa was good with a sword, but Jack was better and quicker. But ghosts don\'t die. He couldn\'t kill Barbossa, and Barbossa couldn\'t kill him.\nWill fought the other pirates. Then, suddenly, he saw Elizabeth.\n\"I want to help you,\" she said.\nShe took a sword and started to fight.\nBut Barbossa saw Elizabeth, too. He put his sword near her head.\n\"I win, Captain Sparrow,\" he said. \"Give me your sword, or the girl dies.\"\nJack didn\'t move. He looked at Elizabeth and then at Will. He took out his gun and looked at Barbossa. Then he shot Barbossa.\nBarbossa smiled.\n\"Are you stupid? You wait ten years and then you use your gun on me. You can\'t kill me!\"\n\"He\'s not stupid,\" said Will.\nHe stood next to the box of pirate gold with the medallion in his hand. His hand was bloody. He put the medallion in the box.\nBarbossa stopped talking. He looked down at his shirt and saw blood. Then he fell down, dead.\nAt the same time, on the Dauntless, the other pirates changed, too. The skeletons were now men.\n\"What\'s happening?\" said one of them. \"I feel...\"\nNorrington\'s men fought them easily. Some pirates died.\nThe men put the other pirates in chains.\nIn the cave, Jack cut his hand. He put some blood onto his medallion and put the medallion in the box. He took some other gold from the floor. Then he left the cave with Elizabeth and Will. But the Black Pearl wasn\'t there. He sat down.\n\"I\'m sorry, Jack,\" Elizabeth said.\n\"I understand,\" said Jack. \"I was late, so they didn\'t wait. They were right. Pirates don\'t wait for anybody.\"\n\nChapter fifteen\nThe Last of the Pirates\nJack stood in front of the governor, Commodore Norrington, Norrington\'s sailors, and people from the town.\n\"It\'s time, Jack Sparrow,\" said the governor. \"You\'re a pirate, and now you have to die!\"\n\"But Father!\" shouted Elizabeth. \"He\'s a good man. He helped me, and he helped your men.\" \"I know,\" said the governor. \"But he\'s a pirate.\"\nSuddenly, Will was at Elizabeth\'s side. \"I love you, Elizabeth,\" he said. \"I wanted to tell you before, but I couldn\'t.\"\nThen he ran to Jack and threw him a sword. They fought Norrington\'s men. Elizabeth and her father watched.\n\"Shoot Sparrow!\" shouted Norrington. \"Use your guns!\"\nWill stood in front of Jack.\n\"Shoot him, and you shoot me,\" he said.\n\"Will!\" said the governor. \"What are you doing? This man is a pirate!\"\n\"And a good man!\" Will shouted.\n\"You\'re nobody, Turner,\" said Norrington.\nWill looked at him.\n\"I\'m the man between you and Jack,\" he said.\nElizabeth stood next to Will.\n\"And my place is here, too!\" she said.\nNorrington looked from Will to Elizabeth. He knew now. She didn\'t love him. She loved Will.\nJack looked at the people around them.\n\"Friends,\" he said. \"Remember this day. On this day you almost killed...\"\nBut he didn\'t finish. He fell back into the harbor.\nEverybody ran and looked down. There, below them, they saw the Black Pearl. And on the Black Pearl were Jack\'s sailors. They were there for their captain.\nNorrington looked at Will. Then he looked at his sword.\n\"This is a good sword,\" he said. \"A good man made it. I hope you\'re a good man, Will Turner.\" He turned to Elizabeth. \"I hope you two will be very happy, Miss Swann,\" he said.\nA sailor ran to them.\n\"Commodore Norrington, sir, do we follow the Black Pearl?\"\n\"Not now. I think we can give them some time. We\'ll follow them later.\"\nHe walked away.\nThey were there for their captain.\nWill looked at Elizabeth and she smiled back at him. \"Oh dear,\" said the governor. \"He isn\'t a sailor - he isn\'t a captain. He\'s only a blacksmith.\"\n\"He\'s a pirate!\" said Elizabeth. She smiled again.\n***\nJack swam to the Black Pearl and climbed onto the ship. \"You came for me!\" he said to Gibbs. Gibbs looked at the floor. \"I know it was wrong of us. But...\"\nJack smiled. He looked back at Port Royal. Then he looked out across the ocean. It was a beautiful day. AnaMaria was at the front of the ship. She turned to him. \"Captain Sparrow,\" she said, \"the Black Pearl is yours.\" Jack took off his hat and his coat.

They stood in lines. After a long time, Bruce got his plate of horrible food. He took the plate and walked to a table. A very big man stood in front of him.\n\'Give me your food,\' said the man.\n\'No,\' Bruce said.\nThe man hit Bruce in the face. Bruce dropped his plate and fell to the floor. When he got up, there were seven big men in front of him. Two of them took Bruce by the arms. He used his legs - hard - and they fell.\nThen - CRRAAACCCCK!\nAt the sound of the gun, all the prisoners quickly got down on the floor. A prison officer took Bruce\'s arm.\n\'You\'re coming with me,\' he said.\n\'Why?\' asked Bruce. \'So I\'m safe?\'\n\'No,\' said the officer. \'So they\'re safe!\'\nThe officer pushed Bruce into a room and closed the door with a bang. It was very dark in the room, but Bruce saw that he was not alone. There was a man in the corner. He didn\'t look like a prisoner. He wore good clothes.\n\'My name is Ducard,\' he said. \'I work for Ra\'s al Ghul. Do you know him?\'\n\'Is he a criminal?\' Bruce asked.\n\'He is not a criminal,\' said Ducard. \'He is a great man with very clever ideas. He knows that you\'re in trouble, Mr Wayne. He wants to help you.\'\nDucard walked to the door and shouted. The officer came and opened it. Ducard turned to Bruce.\n\'There is a very special flower,\' he said. \'It grows on the mountain near here. It\'s blue. Find it and take it to the top of the mountain. There you will find the answer to your question.\'\n\'And what is my question?\' asked Bruce.\n\"\'Where am I going?\"\' said Ducard. And he left.\n\'Why is Ducard interested in me? How does he know about me?\' Bruce asked himself. He sat on the hard bed and began to think about his life. He remembered that terrible day in Gotham many years ago.\nHe is a little boy. He is playing with his friend, Rachel. They are running in the garden at his home, Wayne Manor. There is an old well in the garden. Bruce climbs onto the well and laughs. \'Look at me, Rachel, I\'m-\'\nSuddenly he isn\'t laughing. He\'s shouting.\n\'Help! Help! I\'m falling-\'\nAnd he falls down and down and down into the dark well. He hits the floor with a bang!\n\'Agh! My leg!\' he cries. It feels terrible.\nThen he hears some strange sounds. He isn\'t alone in the well! Help! What is it? He looks up and sees a cloud of terrible black things. Bats! They are flying towards him and into him. Their teeth are like knives. He thinks he is going to die. He makes himself into a ball and shouts. \'Help! Help!\' Then everything goes black.\nThe next thing he remembers... he is in bed.\nThe only person in the bedroom with him is Alfred. Alfred has always worked for the Wayne family.\n\'You had a very bad fall, Master Bruce,\' says Alfred. \'But you\'re going to be OK.\' Alfred waits for a moment, then he asks, \'Why do we fall, Master Bruce?\'\nBruce knows the answer, but he can\'t remember it.\n\'I can\'t remember,\' says Bruce. \'Tell me.\'\n\'We fall,\' says Alfred with a smile, \'so that we can learn to get up again.\'\nBruce started to climb the mountain. He found the blue flower easily. He climbed higher. Up and up he went. It got colder and colder. Soon he was walking on ice. It started to snow heavily. Bruce was cold and unhappy. And very tired.\n\'I have to get to the top,\' he thought, \'but I don\'t know if I can.\'\nThen at last he saw a big building. He pushed open the heavy door and went in.\nRa\'s al Ghul was sitting in a big chair. Ducard was next to him. And there was a line of Ninjas with swords in their hands... ready to fight.\nBruce was frightened. He quickly showed them the blue flower in his hand. Ducard took the flower.\n\'Are you ready to start?\' he asked.\n\'Ready? Oh no,\' Bruce said, \'I\'m so tired.\'\nDucard threw him to the floor. \'You must always be ready,\' he said. \'Here we will teach you to be ready.\'\nOne day, Ducard said to Bruce, \'You\'re not frightened of me, are you, Bruce? What are you frightened of?\'\n\'Bats,\' answered Bruce, and he told Ducard about the bats in the well. \'My father told me something important about the bats in the well.\' He said, \"The bats flew at you because they were frightened of you. All things are frightened of something, even scary things like bats.\" I didn\'t know that. My father was very clever. I loved him very much. But soon after that, he died. A criminal killed both my parents. His name was Joe Chill.\'\nIt\'s the evening. They are at a play. Suddenly there are bats in the show. They fly around above the singers and dancers. Bruce is frightened, so they leave early. But in the street outside, there is a man with a gun. He wants money. He takes their money but he wants more. And then - BANG! - he fires his gun. Bruce\'s mother shouts. Bruce\'s father falls to the floor. BANG! He fires again. Bruce\'s mother falls to the floor. This is the worst moment of Bruce\'s life. And it is all his fault.\n\'It wasn\'t your fault, Bruce,\' said Ducard. \'You were very young.\'\nHe was giving Bruce a lesson on a river. It was thick ice. They were fighting with swords.\n\'You must always look very carefully at the things around you, Bruce,\' said Ducard.\nSuddenly he hit the ice with his sword.\nCRRAAACCCCK!\nThe ice broke and Bruce crashed into the black water below.\nBruce had lessons with Ducard for many months. He learned to fight with his hands and his feet. He learned to fight with a sword and climb tall buildings quickly and quietly. He learned many things. But most of all he learned to use his ears and eyes, and he learned how to think quickly.\n\'It\'s time to test you,\' said Ducard one day. \'Today you must fight all the Ninjas.\'\nSo Bruce fought all the Ninjas with his sword. It was a very long fight, but in the end he won.\n\'You fight very well now,\' said Ducard. \'I think you are ready.\'\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Batman begins', 36164, 11701),

He went from school to school and university to university. He never stayed long in one place.\nBruce is twenty. He is going back to Gotham by train. Alfred meets him at the station. On the way to Wayne Manor he sees that everything is different. Everywhere is dirty. Many houses are empty. Many shops are closed. People are sleeping on the streets.\n\'Things are very bad in Gotham now, Master Bruce,\' Alfred tells him. \'But Wayne Manor is still your home. Your father was a great man, and one day you will be a great man too.\'\nIt is the afternoon on the same day. Bruce is sitting on his bed. \'Joe Chill will be free today,\' he thinks. \'He killed my parents twelve years ago. And today I\'m going to kill him.\' He takes a gun out of his bag.\nHis old friend, Rachel, comes to the house. She is an Assistant District Attorney - an important lawyer in Gotham now.\n\'Wow!\' he thinks when he sees her. \'She is so beautiful.\' They drive to the prison.\n\'Why are they freeing Joe Chill today?\' he asks.\n\'When he was in prison, he was in a room with Carmine Falcone, the famous criminal,\' Rachel explains. \'They talked and he learned lots of things about Falcone. He\'s going to give that information to the police.\'\nThey arrive outside the prison. The newspaper people are waiting. Joe Chill comes out. There are police all around him. Bruce gets out of Rachel\'s car and walks towards Chill. He has his hand in his pocket... on his gun.\nBut - suddenly - a blonde woman pushes through the people. She runs up to Chill. She has a gun in her hand.\n\'Falcone says \"Hi, Joe\",\' she shouts. BANG! BANG! She kills Joe Chill.\nJoe Chill was dead. But Bruce didn\'t feel better. It wasn\'t the answer.\nDucard took Bruce\'s blue flower. He pulled the dry flower into little pieces and made a small fire with it.\n\'Smell your flower now,\' he said to Bruce.\nBruce put his nose near the smoke. The smell was terrible. He suddenly started to remember the worst days of his life... He was falling down the well... He was seeing his parents\' blood in the street...\n\'You are frightened of these things. Look at them. Fight them. Now!\' said Ducard.\nHe pointed to a large wooden box. Bruce opened it.\nWHOOOOSSSH!\nHundreds of bats flew out of the box. Bruce wanted to shout and run. But he didn\'t.\n\'No,\' he thought, \'I must be strong.\'\nHe stood there quietly. He didn\'t move. He didn\'t say a word.\n\'Well done!\' said Ra\'s al Ghul. \'You are not frightened now. You are ready to join my Ninjas.\'\nHe gave Bruce a light. \'Take this light and give your life to me.\'\nBruce took the light. \'Where must I go with your men?\' he asked.\n\'To Gotham,\' answered Ra\'s al Ghul. \'Gotham must die. You must kill all the people there.\'\n\'No!\' shouted Bruce. This could not be real.\n\'We have taught you many things,\' said Ra\'s al Ghul. \'Now you must do this for us.\'\n\'I won\'t do it!\' shouted Bruce. He threw the light on the wooden floor. It broke. A fire started and moved quickly around the room. It grew and grew. It reached the boxes of explosives in the cupboards. They started to explode.\nBANG! BANG!\nNinjas ran everywhere. The roof started to fall. It fell on Ra\'s al Ghul and killed him. As Bruce ran to the door, he saw Ducard\'s body on the floor. He wasn\'t dead. Bruce pulled Ducard out of the building and into the snow.\nHe pulled him down the icy mountain. Ducard was very heavy. Once he almost fell over the edge of the mountain, but Bruce saved him.\nAfter some time they came to some houses. Bruce left Ducard with an old man there.\n\'You saved his life. I will tell him,\' said the old man. \'Where are you going?\'\n\'I\'m going home,\' said Bruce.\nBruce walked down the rest of the mountain. He phoned Alfred.\n\'I need you, Alfred,\' he said. \'Please come and get me.\'\nAlfred flew to Bhutan in the Wayne family plane and took Bruce back to Gotham. He told Bruce all about the terrible changes in Gotham. Carmine Falcone was the crime boss in the city now. Everyone was frightened of him. And William Earle sat in Bruce\'s father\'s chair at Wayne Enterprises, the Wayne family business in Wayne Tower.\n\'Bruce Wayne is dead,\' Earle told everyone. \'I\'m the boss now.\'\nBruce listened carefully to Alfred.\n\'I\'m going to save Gotham, Alfred,\' he said.\nWhen they arrived home at Wayne Manor, Bruce saw a small black thing high on the wall.\n\'What\'s that, Alfred?\' he asked.\n\'It\'s a bat, sir,\' answered Alfred. \'There are lots of bats around here.\'\nBruce suddenly ran out of the house. He ran to the well in the garden and climbed down and down. He reached the floor. It was very dark but he could feel a cold wind. He found a hole in the wall and climbed through. He could hear water. It was quite near. He followed the black walls until they opened into a big cave. A river ran through the cave. And everywhere there were bats - hundreds and hundreds of bats.\nBruce smiled.\nThe next morning Bruce put on a new suit and went to Wayne Tower.\nThe woman at the front desk at Wayne Enterprises tried to stop him. \'You can\'t go in there,\' she said. \'They\'re having a business meeting.\'\nBut Bruce opened the door and went in. There were a lot of men sitting around a long table. And at the end of the table was William Earle.\n\'Good morning, Mr Earle. Good morning, everyone,\' said Bruce.\nEarle\'s face went white but he quickly tried to smile.\n\'My boy! How nice to see you!\' he said. \'You\'re back. What a surprise! A nice surprise!\'\n\'I\'ve come back to work here,\' said Bruce. \'I want to learn the family business.\'\nBruce started work in the Applied Sciences office. This was the new ideas office, but Wayne Enterprises didn\'t seem to be very interested in new ideas these days. The only other person in the office was Lucius Fox. Lucius was a friend of Bruce\'s father, before he died.\nBruce looked around the big room. It was full of strange and exciting things.\n\'What\'s this?\' he asked, and pointed to a black suit.\n\'It\'s a body suit,\' said Lucius. \'It can stop a knife. It can even stop a gun.\'\n\'Can I have it?\' asked Bruce.\n\'Of course,\' said Lucius. \'All these things are yours anyway.\'\nBruce took the body suit home and down to the cave. \'Soon,\' he thought, \'I will be ready.\'\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Batman begins', 36280, 11701),

His name was Sergeant James Gordon. Bruce knew that he was a good police officer. He wanted to talk to Gordon now.\nBut he didn\'t go as Bruce. He put on his black body suit and a mask.\nWhen Batman appeared in Gordon\'s office, the sergeant was surprised and frightened.\n\'Who are you?\' he asked. \'What do you want?\'\n\'Don\'t be frightened, Sergeant Gordon,\' said Batman. \'I need your help. I know Carmine Falcone is the biggest criminal in Gotham. Why is everyone frightened of him? Why does no one stop him?\'\n\'Because...\' said Gordon, \'he pays all the important people in Gotham!\'\nBruce went to the river for the first time in many years. There were lots of people there. They didn\'t have homes. They slept in the streets every night.\nSome people were standing around a fire. Bruce stood with them and warmed his hands. He looked across the street and pointed to a door.\n\'Is that Carmine Falcone\'s club?\' he asked.\n\'Yeah,\' someone said.\nThe next day at work, Lucius Fox said, \'Come with me, Mr Wayne. I want to show you something.\'\nBruce followed him into a big room. There, in the centre of the room, was a fantastic car.\nA few moments later, they were in the car and Bruce was driving it faster and faster along the road.\n\'Go slower, Mr Wayne!\' shouted Lucius.\n\'No way!\' shouted Bruce. \'This is fantastic! This isn\'t an ordinary car. It\'s more like a plane. Can I have it?\'\n\'Of course,\' shouted Lucius. \'All these things are yours anyway!\'\nLater Bruce drove the car back to Wayne Manor. I\'ll call it the Batmobile,\' he told Alfred.\nBruce was a man of the night now. He was Batman.\nHe stood on top of a building near Falcone\'s club. He watched the street by the river. He saw a police officer talking to a group of ship workers. The officer took out a small white bag and gave it to the workers. Drugs! So some of the Gotham police were bad too. Falcone was paying everyone.\nFalcone sat in his office with Dr Crane, the boss of Arkham Asylum for the mentally ill.\n\'Our boss is arriving very soon,\' said Crane. \'When I tell him about the money - his money - he won\'t be happy.\'\n\'Don\'t tell him,\' said Falcone. \'I won\'t take any more. This is the last time.\'\nHe gave Crane a small bag.\n\'Do you want to test the drugs now?\' he asked. Suddenly there was a loud bang and the sound of guns. Crane quickly escaped through the door. Batman flew into the room.\n\'What are you?\' asked Falcone.\n\'I\'m Batman. Everything changes tonight.\'\nBatman crossed the city to Rachel\'s house. He climbed through her bedroom window. \'Rachel, wake up!\' he said. \'I want to tell you something. Everything changes tonight!\'\n\'And who are you?\'\n\'A friend. I want to do good, like you. I want to fight the bad people of Gotham.\'\nSergeant Gordon arrived at the river. A lot of newspaper people were there. They were taking photos. Next to a ship there was a large box full of small bags of drugs. Falcone\'s men were lying behind the box.\n\'Fantastic!\' said Gordon. \'Where\'s Falcone? He always escapes trouble.\'\n\'Not this time. Look. He\'s over there,\' someone said.\nGordon looked. There was a big light next to the river. A man was lying across the light. He wasn\'t moving. It was Falcone.\nRachel read the newspaper the next day and saw the photo of Falcone on the front page. She smiled.\nAt the police station, Sergeant Gordon\'s boss was very angry.\n\'Who did this to Falcone?\' he shouted. \'Find him fast! The police look stupid because of him.\'\n\'I think he\'s trying to help us, sir,\' Gordon said.\n\'We don\'t need his help!\' shouted his boss.\n\'Well, I think we probably do,\' thought Gordon. But he didn\'t say anything.\nDr Crane was visiting Falcone at the police station.\n\'Tell the police I\'m mentally ill,\' Falcone said to him, \'or I\'ll tell them about you and the drugs.\'\nCrane was angry. \'What do you know about me and the drugs?\' he asked.\n\'I know that you test them on people in your hospital,\' said Falcone. \'I know the boss is planning something big.\'\n\'Would you like to see my mask?\' said Dr Crane suddenly. \'I use it in my tests. People are very frightened of it. They don\'t like it at all.\'\nHe opened his bag and took out a horrible mask. He put it on.\n\'How do I look?\'\nWHOOOOSSSH!!\nSuddenly white smoke came out of his bag.\nFalcone tried to shout but his nose and his mouth were on fire. Water came out of his eyes. He saw horrible things in front of his eyes. Crane quickly put the mask back in his bag and shut it.\nHe called a police officer.\n\'I think Mr Falcone is certainly mentally ill,\' he said to the officer. \'We\'ll move Mr Falcone to Arkham Asylum. We can take care of him there.\'\nEarle was angry. Bruce Wayne was back in Gotham. Earle wanted to sell Wayne Enterprises for a lot of money, but now he couldn\'t.\nAnd now he had another problem. His Number 2 at Wayne Enterprises, Rogers, was telling him about it.\n\'One of our biggest ships has disappeared,\' said Rogers.\n\'There\'s a big, expensive machine on that ship,\' said Earle. \'A very dangerous machine that can change water into steam.\'\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Batman begins', 36397, 11701),

He took two beautiful women with him, one on each arm. After dinner, the women wanted to swim in the hotel swimming pool.\n\'It\'s closed,\' said the waiter.\n\'Then I will buy this hotel and open the swimming pool!\' said Bruce. He jumped into the pool with the two women.\nLater, when Bruce was leaving the hotel with the two women, he suddenly saw Rachel. She wore a fantastic dress and looked beautiful. She was just going into the restaurant.\n\'You haven\'t changed much, have you, Bruce?\' she said. \'It\'s all fun and no work for you, isn\'t it?\'\n\'Hey, Rachel. This isn\'t the real me.\'\n\'The things you do are important, Bruce, not the things you say.\' And she walked away.\nBatman went to see Sergeant Gordon.\n\'There was someone in Falcone\'s office with him that night,\' he said. \'He was testing the drugs. Do you know who it was?\'\n\'No, I don\'t,\' answered Gordon. \'Dr Crane from Arkham Asylum often visits Falcone. Perhaps it was him.\'\n\'Yes, perhaps it was,\' said Batman. \'I think I\'ll go to Arkham Asylum.\'\n\'It\'s not safe,\' said Gordon. \'It\'s in the Narrows, a very dangerous part of Gotham.\'\n\'Not for me,\' said Batman.\nBatman soon arrived at the Narrows. Behind Arkham Asylum was a dark building. Batman went inside and found a very big ship\'s box. It was difficult to open. At last he was able to push open the top. Inside there was a machine - it was the size of a big car. Batman read the words on the box: \'WAYNE ENTERPRISES 47B1-ME\'.\nTwo people came into the building. One was a ship worker. The other was a man in a dark suit. They didn\'t see Batman.\n\'What are the boss\'s orders?\' asked the man in the dark suit.\n\'We keep the machine here until he\'s ready,\' said the ship worker.\n\'Fine,\' said the man in the dark suit. It was Dr Crane.\nBatman suddenly flew from the box to the floor.\n\'No, it isn\'t fine,\' he said. He hit the ship worker in the face and he fell to the floor. Crane quickly put on his mask, and then he waved his arm at Batman. WHOOOOSSSSSHH\nA cloud of white smoke came out of his coat.\nBatman\'s nose and mouth were suddenly on fire. He started to see all the worst things from his life in front of his eyes.\n\'I\'ve felt this way before,\' he thought. \'But where?\'\nThen he remembered - Ra\'s al Ghul, the wooden box, the bats, the building on fire...\nHe got to the window on his hands and feet.\nCrane watched him. \'You\'re going to die, Batman,\' he said.\nBatman climbed slowly through the window, up the wall and onto the roof.\nHe pulled out his mobile phone.\n\'Alfred,\' he said. \'Alfred, I-I need you. Please come quickly. I\'m ill. And I need a blood test.\'\nTerrible thoughts were now in Bruce\'s head. He was at the show... the bats... his parents... a gun... blood in the street...\nAnd then - nothing.\nHe opened his eyes. He was home, in his bedroom. Alfred came in.\n\'How long have I been asleep?\' Bruce asked.\n\'Two days, sir,\' answered Alfred. \'It\'s your birthday today.\'\n\'It was the white smoke,\' said Bruce. \'Luckily there wasn\'t very much of it. But I\'ve felt like that once before in my life. On the mountain in Bhutan. But this time it seemed much stronger.\'\n\'I\'ve got the results of the blood test,\' said Alfred.

But I know someone who can make an antidote.\'\nThe next day, Bruce showed the results to Lucius Fox. \'This was in your blood?!\' he said. \'You\'re lucky you didn\'t die!\'\n\'Yes, I\'ve been very lucky,\' said Bruce. \'Can you make an antidote?\'\n\'I think so,\' said Fox, \'but it won\'t be easy.\'\n\'One more thing,\' said Bruce. \'Do you know what Wayne Enterprises 47B1-ME is?\'\n\'No, I don\'t,\' said Fox. \'But I can probably find out.\'\nSergeant Gordon went to see Rachel.\n\'Will Falcone go to prison this time?\' he asked her.\n\'I think so,\' said Rachel. \'It\'s in all the newspapers.\'\n\'Batman came to see me, Miss Dawes,\' said Gordon. \'He asked for my help.\'\n\'Yes, I know,\' said Rachel. \'He came to see me too.

Suddenly he felt an arm around him and he was flying up and up.\nBatman dropped him carefully onto the roof.\nThen Gordon saw Rachel lying there.\n\'What\'s happened to her?\' he asked.\n\'Crane gave her a dangerous drug,\' said Batman. \'She\'ll die very soon. I must get the antidote for her.\'\n\'How will you escape?\' asked Gordon.\n\'I\'m going to call for help,\' said Batman.\nHe pushed something on his shoe - it made a very high sound.\nA big, black cloud started to grow in the sky above Gotham. It grew and grew and moved nearer and nearer. Finally it came down on the hospital roof.\nBats! Thousands of bats!\nThey flew all around Bruce and Rachel. The bats hid Batman and Rachel until they reached the Batmobile. Batman drove home to the Batcave. When they arrived, Bruce looked at Rachel carefully. Her eyes were closed and she wasn\'t moving. She was cold. He carried her from the Batmobile to the worktable. He gave her the antidote. He hoped that it wasn\'t too late.\nAt Arkham Asylum there were police everywhere.\nA young police officer ran over to Sergeant Gordon.\n\'Sir!\' he shouted. \'There\'s something that you must see.\'\nGordon followed him into another big room. In the centre of the floor was a small door. It was open.\nGordon looked through the door and saw the river below. There were five or six large bottles next to the door.\n\'They\'ve used the river for something,\' said Gordon, \'but what?\'\nHe looked at the bottles.\n\'I want to speak to someone at the Water Office,\' he shouted. \'Now!\'\nRachel woke up. She felt terrible.\n\'How do you feel?\' someone asked. She knew the voice. She looked at the face. It was Batman!\n\'Where am I?\' she asked. \'Why did you bring me here?\'\n\'You were very ill,\' he said. \'I rescued you.\'\n\'I remember now. That horrible mask,\' she said. \'It was Crane. I must tell Sergeant Gordon.\'\nShe tried to move.\n\'No, don\'t get up. Stay where you are,\' said Batman. \'Sergeant Gordon has got Crane already.\'\n\'Why did you save my life?\' she asked.\n\'Gotham needs you,\' he said. \'Here, take this. It will help you sleep. When you wake up, please find Sergeant Gordon. Give him these.\'\nHe held up two small bottles. \'Only Gordon. No one else.\'\n\'What are they?\' she asked.\n\'The antidote to this killer drug,\' said Batman. \'One bottle is for Gordon himself. He can use the other bottle to make some more of the antidote for everyone.\'\n\'Crane wasn\'t the boss. He was working for someone else,\' Rachel said. \'Something al Ghul.\'\n\'Ra\'s al Ghul,\' said Batman. \'No, it\'s not Ra\'s al Ghul. He\'s dead. I was there when he died.\'\nBut Rachel was asleep.\n \nChapter six\nA Surprise Guest\nIn the empty workroom, Sergeant Gordon was talking on the phone.\n\'Someone has put a dangerous drug into the city\'s water,\' Gordon said.\n\'Well, we test the water every day,\' answered the man from the Water Office, \'and today\'s results seem fine.\'\n\'Perhaps it\'s safe to drink but dangerous to smell,\' said Gordon.\n\'That\'s possible,\' said the water man.\nWhen he finished his phone call, Gordon saw the large ship\'s box.\n\'What\'s that?\' he asked. \'Let\'s open it.\' They got the top off and found a machine.\n\'It\'s bigger than a car,\' said an officer. \'What does it say on it?\'\n\'WAYNE ENTERPRISES 47B1-ME,\' Gordon read.\n\'What does it do?\' asked an officer.\n\'I\'ve no idea,\' answered Gordon. \'But no one must go near it. OK?\'\nBruce left the cave and went up into the house. Everyone was having a great time at his birthday party. When he appeared, they all sang \'Happy Birthday to you!\'\nBruce walked around saying hello to his guests. Finally he found the person he wanted. Lucius Fox.\n\'That machine-\' he said quietly, \'Have you found out anything?\'\n\'Yes, I have. It can change water into steam,\' Fox said.\nBruce thought for a moment. \'So you could put a dangerous drug in the water,\' he said. \'And then you could change the water into steam and kill everyone in the city. Could you?\'\n\'Yes, you could,\' said Fox.\n\'Oh no!\' Bruce went quietly across the room towards the door. He had to leave as soon as possible.\nBut on the way, a woman took his arm. It was Mrs Delane, an old friend of his father.\n\'Bruce!\' she said. \'I want you to meet someone.\'\n\'I\'m sorry. I can\'t stop now, Mrs Delane,\' said Bruce. \'I have to...\'\nBut then he looked at the man with Mrs Delane. The man wore a blue flower in his jacket.\n\'This is Mr al Ghul, Bruce,\' said Mrs Delane.\n\'You\'re not Ra\'s al Ghul,\' Bruce said to the man.\n\'No, you\'re right, Bruce,\' said a voice behind him.\nHe turned around. It was Ducard.\n\'He isn\'t Ra\'s al Ghul,\' said \'Ducard\'. \'I am. I\'m not Ducard. I never was. And you, Bruce, were my best student until you escaped.\'\nBruce looked around the room and saw that he didn\'t know some of the people there. They weren\'t his friends. They were Ninjas!\nHis guests were in danger. They had to get out fast. What could he do? He took a glass and shouted, \'Let\'s drink to my birthday! Let\'s drink to all my guests! You don\'t like me, do you? You\'re here because you like my money. You just want some free food and drink!\'\nThe guests were very upset and angry. They left the house at once. They got in their cars and drove away.\nRa\'s al Ghul laughed. \'They will die very soon anyway,\' he said.\n\'So was Crane working for you?\' asked Bruce.\n\'Yes, he was,\' said Ra\'s al Ghul. \'But he was only interested in money. I want much more than that. When Gotham dies, people everywhere will be frightened. There will be fighting and killing all over the world. Man will disappear. No more people. The world will be wonderful again. I saved you, Bruce, but you fought me. You set fire to my home. Since then your activities have made trouble for us. Now we\'re going to make trouble for you.\'\nRa\'s al Ghul shouted an order to his men, \'Go ahead!\'\nThe Ninjas started to set fire to the furniture.\nSome kilometres away at Arkham Asylum, four police officers were standing around the machine.\n\'What did Gordon say? \"No one must go near it,\"\' one of them said. \'Except us, of course.\' They all laughed. Another one looked at his watch. \'It\'s time,\' he said.\nThey turned on the machine and then put explosives along the wall.\nThey weren\'t following Sergeant Gordon\'s orders.\nAt the same time, high above the city, a train driver looked at his watch.\n\'The train stops here,\' he said. \'Everyone out!\'\nThe passengers got out. The same thing was happening on buses and trains all over the city. Everything in Gotham stopped.\nSergeant Gordon was standing outside Arkham Asylum.\nRachel ran towards him. She gave him the two small bottles. \'These are from Batman.\'\nFOOOOM!\nBefore he could answer, there was a big explosion. Gordon ran towards the room with the machine. There was no wall. Four police officers were pushing the machine outside. One of them pushed something on the machine. It started to make a strange sound.\nFOOOOM!\nThere was a second explosion.\nFOOOOM!\nThen another.\nFOOOOM!\nThen another.\nThere was steam everywhere. A small cloud of steam moved towards Gordon. The smell reached him. His nose and mouth were on fire.\nAt the Water Office, the workers were looking at a map of Gotham City. There were small lights all over the map. All the lights were green. Except one. The light at Arkham Asylum was red.\nWayne Manor was on fire.\n\'Have you come to kill me?\' Bruce asked Ra\'s.\n\'No,\' said Ra\'s. \'I\'ve come to ask you a question. Will you join us?\'\n\'Never!\' said Bruce. \'I don\'t want to be part of this.\'\n\'Then fight me,\' said Ra\'s, \'and die with Gotham.\'\nHe took out a sword.\nThey fought and fought until finally Bruce stood over Ra\'s with his sword above Ra\'s head.\n\'You taught me very well, Ra\'s,\' he said.\n\'Yes, I did,\' said Ra\'s, \'but you always forget to look very carefully at the things around you.\'\nCRRRAAACCCK!\nBruce looked up. The roof was on fire. Part of it was falling towards him.\nBANG!\nIt hit him and he fell to the floor.\n\'Goodbye, my friend,\' said Ra\'s. He ran out of the building. A car was waiting for him.\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Batman begins', 36609, 11701),

(37260, '\n\nThe Journey Begins\nThe wonderful views of snow-topped mountains passed unnoticed as the train sped away from Syria towards Istanbul. As the Belgian detective M. Hercule Poirot drank his coffee, he watched the only other person in the restaurant carriage - a tall, thin young lady, perhaps twenty-eight years old. From the way that she ate her breakfast, she seemed to be an experienced and confident traveller. He admired her pale face, tidy dark hair and cool grey eyes. A good-looking woman, he thought, but perhaps a little too cold and efficient to be described as pretty.\nSoon a tall, thin man entered the restaurant carriage. He was between forty and fifty, with greying hair and skin darkened by the sun. He spoke to the woman. His accent was English.\n\'Morning, Miss Debenham.\'\n\'Good morning, Colonel Arbuthnot,\' she replied.\n\'Do you mind if I sit with you?\'\n\'Of course not. Please, sit.\' She smiled politely.\nHe sat down and ordered his breakfast. He looked quickly towards M. Poirot - at his enormous, curled moustache and strange, egg-shaped head - then looked away. \'Just a silly looking foreigner,\' he thought to himself.\nThe British pair exchanged a few polite words over their breakfast, and at lunchtime they sat together again. The man spoke of his life in the army in India, and occasionally asked the girl questions about Baghdad, where she had been a governess. When they discovered that they had some friends in common, they became more friendly.\n\'Are you stopping in Istanbul?\' the man asked.\n\'No, I\'m going straight through. I saw all the sights two years ago, on my way to Baghdad.\'\n\'Well, I must say I\'m very glad about that. I\'m going straight through too.\' His face went a little red.\n\'That will be nice,\' said Miss Debenham without emotion.\nThe train stopped late that evening at Konya. The two English travellers went outside for some fresh air and exercise. After a few minutes, Poirot decided to get some air too, and started to walk along the platform. It was bitterly cold.\nOut of the darkness, he heard two voices. Arbuthnot was speaking. \'Mary -\'\nA girl interrupted him. \'Not now. Not now. When it\'s all over. When it\'s behind us - then -\nM. Poirot silently changed direction. \'Strange,\' he said to himself. It was the voice of Miss Debenham, but a very different one from the cool, efficient voice that he had heard on the train.\nThe next afternoon, the train stopped unexpectedly. Poirot asked the conductor if there was a problem.\nMiss Debenham was just behind him. \'What\'s the matter?\' she asked Poirot in French. \'Why are we stopping?\'\n\'Something caught fire under the restaurant carriage,\' he explained, \'but they are repairing the damage. It is nothing serious.\'\nShe looked impatient. \'But the time! This will delay us.\'\n\'It is possible - yes,\' agreed Poirot.\n\'But we can\'t afford delay! If we are delayed by more than an hour, we will miss our connection with the Orient Express.\'\nHer hands were shaking. She was clearly very upset.\nLuckily, her worries were soon forgotten. Ten minutes later the train was again on its way, and the rest of the journey to Istanbul went very smoothly. M. Poirot went straight to the Tokatlian Hotel. He was looking forward to a few days visiting the sights in Istanbul before he continued his journey home.\nAt the hotel, he asked if he had any letters. There were three, and an urgent message too. This was a surprise.\n\'Unexpected change in Kassner case. Please return immediately,\' he read.\n\'How annoying!\' he said to himself. He looked at the clock.\n\'I must leave Istanbul tonight,\' he told the man at the hotel desk. \'Can you get me a first-class compartment to London?\'\n\'Of course, Monsieur. The train is almost empty in the winter. It leaves at nine o\'clock.\'\n\'Thank you,\' said M. Poirot. He had just enough time for some dinner.\nAs he was ordering his food in the hotel restaurant, he felt a hand on his shoulder.\n\'M. Poirot! What an unexpected pleasure!\' said a voice behind him. The speaker was a short, fat man in his fifties.\n\'M. Bouc!\' cried Poirot.\nM. Bouc was Belgian, and had a high position in the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits. The two men had been friends for many years, since the days when Poirot was a young detective in the Belgian police force.\n\'You are very far from home, my friend,\' said M. Bouc.\n\'Yes. A little business in Syria. But I am heading home tonight - on the Orient Express, if there is a compartment.\'\n\'Excellent! I will be on the same train. Later, you can tell me all your news. You are a famous detective now, I hear.\'\nWith a warm smile, M. Bouc left the restaurant.\nM. Poirot returned to the job of keeping his moustache out of the soup. Soon, though, his attention was caught by two men who were sitting together at a table not far from his. The younger was a friendly-looking man of thirty, clearly an American. The other was in his sixties and seemed at first to be a kind old gentleman. But when his small, shadowy eyes met Poirot\'s, the detective\'s opinion of him changed completely. Just for a second Poirot sensed that the man was dangerous. It seemed that there was a wild animal hidden inside the man\'s body, looking out at the world with those evil eyes.\nM. Poirot soon joined his friend M. Bouc near the hotel desk. Their conversation was interrupted by the hotel worker who was organising M. Poirot\'s train ticket.\n\'It is very strange, Monsieur. All the first-class compartments are booked - and the second-class too.\'\n\'What?\' asked M. Bouc. \'At this time of year? Impossible!\'\n\'But it is true, sir,\' the man replied. \'I am sorry.\'\n\'Well, well,\' M. Bouc said to Poirot, \'do not worry. We will arrange something with the conductor.\' He looked up at the clock. \'Come,\' he said, \'it is time to go.\'\nAt the station, M. Bouc took the conductor to one side.\n\'We must find a compartment for this gentleman here. He is a friend of mine.\'\n\'But we are completely full, Monsieur. It is most unusual.\'\n\'Well,\' said M. Bouc, \'tomorrow there will be more compartments, when we reach Belgrade. The problem is for tonight.\' He paused for a moment. \'Everyone has arrived?\'\nThe conductor looked at his list. \'Number 7 - a second-class compartment. The gentleman - a Mr Harris - has not yet come, and it is four minutes to nine.\'\n\'Then put M. Poirot\'s luggage in number 7,\' said M. Bouc. \'If this Mr Harris arrives, we will tell him that he is too late.\'\nWith words of thanks to M. Bouc, Poirot followed his luggage to compartment 7. Inside it was the tall young American from the hotel.\nHe was not pleased when Poirot entered. \'Excuse me,\' he said in French. \'I think you\'ve made a mistake.\'\n\'There are no other beds on the train, M. MacQueen,\' the conductor apologised. \'The gentleman has to come in here.\'\nPoirot noticed that the conductor seemed almost as annoyed as the American. Perhaps he had been offered money to keep the other bed empty.\nWhen the conductor had left, MacQueen\'s annoyance seemed forgotten.\n\'The train\'s surprisingly full,\' he said with a smile.\nJust then, the train started moving. Their three-day journey across Europe had begun.\nAfter a good night\'s sleep, Poirot spent the morning alone in his compartment, looking at his notes on the case that had called him to London.\nHe had a late lunch with M. Bouc. As they relaxed at the end of the meal, they looked around the restaurant carriage.\n\'If I were a writer, I would use this scene,\' said M. Bouc. \'All around us are people of all classes, of all nationalities, of all ages. For three days these people sleep and eat under one roof. They cannot escape each other. But at the end of the three days they go their separate ways and never see each other again.\'\nThere were thirteen people in the restaurant carriage, and M. Bouc was right: they were a very mixed group. A big, hairy Italian was sitting with a thin, pale Englishman, probably a servant, and an American in a brightly-coloured suit. The American and Italian exchanged business advice while the Englishman stared out of the window. He was clearly not enjoying the conversation.\nAt the next table sat an ugly lady whose clothes and jewellery, though they did nothing to help her appearance, were clearly from the most expensive shops in Paris.\n\'That is Princess Dragomiroff,\' said M. Bouc. \'She is Russian, but her husband got his money out of the country before the Communists took control. So ugly, but what a character!\'\nAt another table, Mary Debenham was sitting with a kind looking middle-aged woman with fair hair and a sheep-like face; with them was an older woman, an American who never seemed to stop talking. Colonel Arbuthnot was at the next table, alone. Against the wall sat a middle-aged woman dressed in black - a servant, Poirot guessed. Then there was a good-looking man of about thirty with a beautiful young woman. Perfectly dressed in the latest fashion, she had pale skin and large brown eyes. Poirot could not take his eyes off her.\n\'A Hungarian diplomat and his wife, I believe,\' said M. Bouc, seeing his friend\'s interest. \'A very attractive couple.\'\nThen there was MacQueen and his employer, the man with the kind face and the small, cruel eyes.\nM. Bouc returned to his compartment while M. Poirot finished his coffee.\n\'My daughter said I would have no trouble with these food tickets,\' he heard the American woman say to Miss Debenham as she paid the waiter. \'But then there\'s money for the waiter, and that bottle of water. Nasty water too. They haven\'t got any Evian, which seems very odd to me.\' She looked crossly at the coins in front of her. \'And look at this rubbish that the waiter\'s given me. Dinars or something. My daughter said -\'\nAt this point, Mary Debenham made a polite excuse and left the table. Colonel Arbuthnot got up and followed her. Very soon the restaurant carriage was empty except for Poirot and MacQueen\'s employer.\nTo the detective\'s surprise, the man came and sat down at his table. \'Good afternoon,\' he said in a quiet, deep voice. \'My name is Ratchett. I think that I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr Hercule Poirot. Is that right?\'\n\'Your information is correct, Monsieur,\' said the detective.\n\'I want you to do a job for me,\' said Ratchett.\nPoirot looked surprised. \'I take very few cases, I\'m afraid.\'\n\'Of course. But this, Mr Poirot, means money. Big money.\' Poirot was silent for a moment. Then he said, \'What do you wish me to do for you, M. - er - Ratchett?\'\n\'Mr Poirot, I am a rich man - a very rich man. Men in my position have enemies. Someone has threatened to kill me. I can look after myself quite well.\' He quickly showed Poirot the gun in his pocket. \'But I\'d like to be especially careful. Remember, we are talking big money, Mr Poirot.\'\nPoirot thought for some minutes. Finally he said, \'I am sorry, Monsieur, but I cannot help you.\'\nThe other man smiled. \'Not even if I give you twenty thousand dollars?\'\n\'No, Monsieur.\'\n\'But why not? Why does this case not interest you?\'\nPoirot stood up. \'Forgive me for being personal, but I do not like your face, M. Ratchett,\' he said.\nThe Orient Express arrived at Belgrade at a quarter to nine that evening. M. Bouc was moved into a carriage that had just joined the train from Athens, and Poirot was given M. Bouc\'s old compartment, number 1. At 9.15, with heavy snow falling outside, the train was on its way again.\nThe strangers of yesterday were already becoming more friendly. Colonel Arbuthnot was standing at the door of his compartment talking to MacQueen.\nTwo doors from Poirot\'s new compartment, the older American woman, Mrs Hubbard, was talking to the sheep-like lady.\n\'Oh, isn\'t this cold weather terrible! I hope your head will be better in the morning. Have you got some aspirin? Are you sure? I\'ve got plenty. Well, good night, my dear.\'\nShe turned to Poirot as the other woman departed.\n\'Poor woman, she\'s Swedish. Some kind of teacher. Very nice, but doesn\'t talk much English. She was very interested to hear about my daughter.\'\nPoirot, like everyone else on the train, now knew all about Mrs Hubbard\'s daughter, who was teaching at a big American college in Turkey. They also knew Mrs Hubbard\'s opinion of Turks, their lazy habits and the terrible condition of their roads.\nThe door next to them opened and the thin, pale manservant came out. Inside, Poirot saw Mr Ratchett sitting up in bed. Then the door was shut.\nMrs Hubbard moved closer to Poirot.\n\'You know, I\'m frightened of that man,\' she said quietly. \'Not the servant - the other man. I can just feel that he\'s dangerous. He\'s next door to me and I don\'t like it. It wouldn\'t surprise me if he was a murderer.\'\nColonel Arbuthnot and MacQueen were coming towards them down the corridor. \'Come into my compartment,\' MacQueen was saying, \'and we can talk some more. So you think that in India the British should -\'\nThe voice suddenly went quiet as the two men entered MacQueen\'s compartment.\n\'I\'m going to bed,\' Mrs Hubbard said to Poirot. \'Good night.\'\nPoirot went into his own compartment, which was the next one beyond Ratchett\'s. He read in bed for about half an hour and then turned out the light.\nHe was woken a few hours later by a cry. It sounded like a cry of pain, from somewhere not far away. This was immediately followed by the ringing of a bell.\nPoirot sat up and switched on the light. He noticed that the train was not moving. Remembering that Ratchett was in the next-door compartment, he got out of bed and opened the door. The conductor was hurrying along the corridor. He knocked on\nRatchett\'s door. No answer. He knocked a second time, just as another bell rang further down the corridor and a light was turned on. From Ratchett\'s compartment, a voice called out, \'Ce n\'est rien. Je me suis trompe.\'\n\'Very good, Monsieur,\' said the conductor. He hurried off again, towards the door where the light was showing.\nPoirot returned to bed, checked his watch and switched off the light. It was twenty-three minutes to one.\nHe could not sleep. The noises on board the train seemed unusually loud. He could hear Ratchett moving around next door, and footsteps in the corridor outside.\nHis throat felt dry. He had forgotten to ask for his usual bottle of water. He looked at his watch again. A quarter past one. He was thinking of ringing for the conductor and asking him for water when he heard another bell ring. Ting... ting... ting...\nPoirot waited: The conductor could not come to two compartments at the same time.\nThe bell sounded again and again. Someone was clearly getting impatient. Finally the conductor came. Poirot heard him apologise. Then there was a woman\'s voice - Mrs Hubbard\'s. She spoke for some time, with the conductor adding a few words here and there. Then the conductor said goodnight and the door was closed.\nPoirot took his chance and rang his own bell. The conductor, when he came, looked upset. \'It is Mrs Hubbard,\' he explained. \'She says that there is a man in her room. Imagine it - in a room of that size! Where could he hide? I told her that it was impossible, but she didn\'t listen. We have enough to worry about already, with this snow -\'\n\'Snow?\'\n\'Yes, Monsieur. There is too much snow on the line. The train has stopped. We might have to wait here for days.\'\nHe brought Poirot the water, then said goodnight.\nPoirot drank a glass of water and began to fall asleep. He was soon wide awake again, though. There had been a loud noise from the next-door compartment. Had something heavy fallen against the door? He jumped out of bed and looked out. Nothing, except a woman in a red dressing gown some distance down the corridor. At the other end of the corridor, the conductor was doing some paperwork. Everything was quiet.\n\'I should stop worrying,\' he said to himself, and went back to bed. This time he slept until morning.\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37259, 11701),

(37268, '\nA Cruel and Dangerous Man\nWhen Poirot woke, the train was still not moving. There was deep snow all around them. In the restaurant carriage, everyone was complaining about the delay.\n\'How long will we be here?\' Mary Debenham asked. \'Doesn\'t anybody know?\'\nHer voice sounded impatient, but she was not upset in the way that she had been at the delay before reaching Istanbul.\nMrs Hubbard replied, \'Nobody knows anything on this train, and nobody\'s trying to do anything. If this was in America, people would at least try to do something! My daughter says -\' The morning continued in this way. Poirot learnt a lot more about Mrs Hubbard\'s daughter and about the habits of Mr Hubbard, who had recently died.\nTurning round, Poirot noticed a conductor at his elbow - not the conductor from the night before, but a big, fair man.\n\'Excuse me, Monsieur,\' he said. \'M. Bouc would be grateful if you could come to him for a few minutes.\'\nPoirot made his excuses to the ladies and followed the conductor to a compartment in the next carriage. M. Bouc was sitting there with a small, dark man, and a man in a blue uniform - the train manager. The conductor from the night before was standing by the window.\n\'My good friend,\' cried M. Bouc, \'we need your help!\'\nM. Bouc was clearly upset. Poirot realised at once that the matter was serious. \'What has happened?\' he asked.\n\'Well, first this terrible snow - this delay. And now -\'\nHe stopped.\n\'And now what?\'\n\'And now a passenger lies murdered in his bed.\'\n\'Which passenger?\' asked M. Poirot.\n\'An American. A man called - called -\' M. Bouc looked at his notes. \'Ratchett. It is a disaster! A murder is bad enough. But the train cannot move. We may be here for days. We have no police on board, and Dr Constantine thinks that the murderer is still among us.\'\nThe small, dark man now spoke. \'The window of M. Ratchett\'s compartment was found wide open, but there were no footprints in the snow. No one left the train that way.\'\n\'At what time was the murder?\' asked the detective.\n\'It is difficult to give an exact time,\' replied the doctor, \'but it was some time between midnight and 2 a.m.\'\n\'And the crime was discovered - when?\'\nM. Bouc turned to Michel, the conductor by the window, who looked pale and frightened.\n\'The waiter from the restaurant carriage wanted to know if Monsieur wanted lunch,\' said the conductor. \'There was no answer. I opened the door with my key, but there was a bolt too.\nI called the train manager. We cut through the bolt and went in. He was - it was terrible. Terrible!\' He hid his face in his hands.\n\'The door was locked and bolted on the inside,\' said Poirot thoughtfully. \'Perhaps he killed himself?\'\n\'Does a man kill himself with twelve knife wounds in the chest?\' asked the doctor.\n\'It was a woman,\' said the train manager, speaking for the first time. \'Only a woman would kill like that.\'\n\'Then it was a very strong woman,\' said the doctor. \'The knife went through bone in some places.\'\n\'So, my friend, you see our problem.\' M. Bouc looked at the detective. \'Can you help us?\'\n\'What exactly do you want me to do?\' M. Poirot asked. \'Take command of the case! When the police arrive, there will be problems, delays, unpleasantness. It would be so much better if the case was already solved when they arrived. And you are the perfect man for the job. Examine the body and interview the passengers. You will not be able to check their stories, but you once said, \"To solve a case, a man just has to be back in his chair and think.\" Do that - and you will know!\'\n\'I accept the case willingly,\' smiled the detective. \'It will help to pass the time.\'\n\'Wonderful!\' said M. Bouc. \'We will help you in any way that we can.\'\n\'First, I would like a plan of the carriage where the murder took place, with a note of the names of the people in each compartment. I will also need their passports and tickets.\'\n\'Michel will get you those.\'\nThe conductor left the compartment.\n\'Who are the other passengers on the train?\' asked M. Poirot. \'In this carriage, Dr Constantine and I are the only travellers. Behind this are the third-class carriages, but they were locked after dinner last night. In front, there is only the restaurant carriage.\'\n\'So it seems likely that the murderer is now in the American\'s carriage,\' said Poirot.\n\'Yes,\' agreed Dr Constantine. \'At half past midnight we were stopped by the snow. No one has left the train since then - or at least, there are certainly no footprints in the snow.\'\n\'First I would like to speak with young M. MacQueen,\' said Poirot. \'He may be able to give us some useful information.\' The train manager fetched MacQueen.\n\'What\'s the problem?\' asked the American nervously as he sat down opposite Poirot. \'Has anything happened?\'\n\'Yes, Monsieur,\' answered the detective. .\'Prepare yourself for a shock. Your employer, M. Ratchett, has been murdered.\' MacQueen\'s eyes seemed brighter, but except for this he showed no signs of shock. \'So they got him after all,\' he said. \'What do you mean, M. MacQueen?\'\nMacQueen paused. \'And you are -?\'\n\'I am a detective working for the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons Lits. My name is M. Hercule Poirot. Now, please, tell me what you mean, They got him after all.\'\n\'Well, he has been getting letters. Threatening letters.\'\n\'Did you see them?\'\n\'Yes. I am - was - his secretary. It was my job to answer his letters. The first came last week. Would you like to see it?\'\n\'Yes, that would he most helpful,\' replied the detective. MacQueen left, and soon returned with a rather dirty piece of notepaper. Poirot read the carefully printed handwriting:\nYou thought you could cheat us, didn\'t you? Well, you were wrong. We\'re going to get you, Ratchett!\n\'And the other letters were similar?\' asked the detective.\n\'Yes, very similar. Ratchett pretended to laugh about them, but I could see that they worried him.\'\n\'How long have you been working for M. Ratchett?\'\n\'A year. He travelled around a lot, but he spoke no languages except English. I was more his translator than his secretary.\'\n\'Now, tell me as much as you can about your employer.\'\n\'That\'s not so easy.\' He looked confused.\n\'He was an American citizen?\'\n\'Yes.\'\n\'What part of America was he from?\'\n\'I don\'t know. I know almost nothing about him. Mr Ratchett never spoke of himself, or his family, or his life in America.\'\n\'Why was that, do you think?\'\n\'Well, I think he was hiding something - something in his past. I\'m not even sure that Ratchett was his real name.\'\n\'One last question. Did you have a good relationship with your employer?\'\n\'Well, yes, I did. I didn\'t like him very much as a person, but I had no problems with him as an employer.\'\n\'You did not like him. Why was that?\'\n\'I can\'t exactly say.\' He paused, then continued, \'He was, I am sure, a cruel and dangerous man. I have no reason for this opinion, M. Poirot, but I feel it very strongly.\'\n\'Thank you for your honesty, Mr MacQueen.\'\nM. Poirot and Dr Constantine went together to the compartment of the murdered man. It was freezing cold inside. The window was pushed down as far as it could go.\n\'I did not like to close it,\' said the doctor. \'Nothing has been touched in here, and I was careful not to move the body when I examined it.\'\n\'Good,\' said Poirot. He checked the window for fingerprints, but there were none. \'Criminals these days are always careful about fingerprints. And you were right, Doctor. There are no footprints in the snow. No one left the carriage through this window - although perhaps the murderer wanted us to think that he did.\'\nPoirot closed the window and turned his attention to the body. Ratchett was lying on his back in the bed. The detective bent down to look at the wounds.\n\'How many wounds are there exactly?\' he asked.\n\'Twelve, I think. Some are very slight, but at least three are serious enough to cause death. And there is something strange. These two wounds - here and here -\' He pointed. \'They are deep, but they have not bled in the normal way.\'\n\'Which means -?\n\'That the man was already dead - dead for some time - when these wounds were made. But that seems impossible.\'\n\'Unlikely, certainly - unless our murderer was worried that he hadn\'t done the job right the first time and came back to make sure.\' He paused, then asked suddenly, \'Were the lights on?\'\n\'No,\' replied the doctor.\nPoirot thought for a moment. \'So we have two murderers. The first did his job, then turned off the light as he left. Later, the second arrived in the dark, did not see that his or her work had been done and struck at a dead body. What do you think?\'\n\'Very good!\' said the doctor. \'That would also explain why some wounds are deep but others are so slight. We have a strong murderer and a weaker one.\'\n\'Yes, but two independent murderers on the same night? It is so unlikely!\' Poirot stopped, then continued, \'Could the deepest wounds be the work of a woman?\'\n\'Perhaps - but only if she was very strong.\'\nPoirot put his hand under the pillow and pulled out the gun that Ratchett had shown him the day before. \'Why didn\'t the American defend himself? The bullets are all there, you see.\' They looked round the room. Ratchett\'s clothes were hanging tidily behind the door. On a small table was a bottle of water, an empty glass, some burnt pieces of paper and a used match.\nThe doctor picked up the empty glass and smelled it. \'This is why Ratchett failed to defend himself. He was drugged.\'\nPoirot felt in Ratchett\'s pockets and soon brought out a box of matches. He compared the matches carefully with the one on the table. \'The match on the table is a different shape from these - shorter and flatter. Perhaps it was the murderer\'s.\'\nThe detective continued to look round the room. Then, with a cry, he bent down and picked up a handkerchief from the floor. It was small and pretty.\n\'The train manager was right!\' he said. \'There is a woman in this case. And she very conveniently leaves us a clue - exactly as it happens in the books and films. And to make things even easier for us, there is a letter H on it.\'\nPoirot made another dive to the floor, and this time stood up with a pipe cleaner in his hand. \'Another convenient clue,\' he smiled. \'And this time it suggests a man, not a woman.\'\nThe doctor was now looking in the front pocket of Ratchett\'s pyjamas. \'Ah!\' he said. \'I didn\'t notice this earlier.\'\nHe showed Poirot a gold pocket watch. The case was badly damaged, and the hands pointed to a quarter past one.\n\'You see?\' cried Constantine. \'This gives us the hour of the crime. It fits perfectly with the medical evidence, that he died between midnight and 2 a.m.\'\n\'It is possible, yes,\' said the detective in a troubled voice.\nHe went back to the little table and examined the burnt bits of paper. \'I need a ladies\' hat box!\' he said softly.\nBefore Dr Constantine was able to ask why, Poirot was in the corridor, calling for the conductor. The conductor soon came in with a hat box borrowed from one of the lady passengers.\n\'There are so many clues in this room,\' Poirot explained to the doctor, who was looking very confused. \'The watch, the pipe cleaner, the handkerchief. But how can we be sure that they are not false clues, left here to confuse us? I am only sure of two clues - the match and the burnt paper. The murderer didn\'t want us to read the words on that paper. Let us see.\'\nFrom the hat box, Poirot took one of the pieces of shaped wire netting over which a hat would normally sit. He flattened it, then carefully placed the burnt pieces of paper on top and covered them with another piece of wire netting. He lit a match and held the wire over the flame. The doctor watched with interest as, slowly, some words appeared - words of fire. \'-member little Daisy Armstrong.\'\n\'Ah!\' cried Poirot. \'So Ratchett was not the dead man\'s real name. We now know his name, and why he left America.\'\n\'We do?\' asked the doctor.\n\'Yes. We must go and tell M. Bouc.\'\nThe two men found M. Bouc finishing lunch in his compartment. \'After lunch, we will empty the restaurant carriage and use it for your interviews,\' M. Bouc said. \'I have ordered some food for you here.\'\nThe doctor and the detective ate quickly. M. Bouc waited until their coffee had been served, then asked, \'Well?\'\n\'I know the real name of the murdered man,\' said Poirot. \'He was Cassetti. Do you remember the Armstrong case?\'\n\'Yes, I think I do,\' answered M. Bouc. \'A terrible business - although I cannot remember the details.\'\n\'Colonel Armstrong was an Englishman, married to the daughter of America\'s most famous actress, Linda Arden. They were living in America when their three-year-old daughter was kidnapped. After messages from the kidnappers, the parents paid them more than two hundred thousand dollars for her return. But instead, the child\'s dead body was discovered. Mrs Armstrong was carrying another baby at the time, and the shock of her daughter\'s murder made her give birth too soon. She and the baby both died. The heartbroken husband then shot himself.\'\n\'Yes, I remember now,\' M. Bouc said softly. \'And there was another death too, wasn\'t there?\'\n\'A French or Swiss girl who worked for the Armstrongs. The police believed that she had helped the kidnappers, although she strongly denied this. She threw herself out of a window. Later, it was proved that she was completely innocent.\'\n\'Terrible!\' said the doctor.\n\'About six months after these events, the police caught Cassetti. He was the leader of a team of gangsters who had kidnapped and killed people in a similar way before. There was no doubt that he was guilty of the Armstrong kidnap too. But Cassetti was very rich, and he used his money to escape punishment for his crimes. After the court case, he disappeared. And now we know where he went. He changed his name to Ratchett and began travelling abroad.\'\n\'What an animal!\' cried M. Bouc. \'He got what he deserved.\'\n\'I agree,\' said M. Poirot. \'But was the murderer another gangster, or someone connected to Daisy Armstrong?\'\n\'Are there any members of the Armstrong family living?\'\n\'I don\'t know,\' replied the detective. \'I seem to remember that Mrs Armstrong had a younger sister.\'\nThere was a knock at the door. \'The restaurant carriage is ready for you, Monsieur,\' said the waiter to M. Bouc.\nThe three men walked down the corridor to begin the interviews.\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37267, 11701),

(37273, '\nPart 3\nA Red Dressing Gown and a Metal Button\nIn the restaurant carriage, everything was ready - a pile of passports and tickets, a plan of the carriage with the names of the passengers marked on it, and writing paper, a pen and ink.\n\'Excellent,\' said Poirot. \'Our first interview will be with the conductor. You probably know something about his character, M. Bouc. Should we believe his evidence?\'\n\'Definitely,\' replied M. Bouc. \'Pierre Michel has worked for the company for fifteen years. A Frenchman - very honest.\' Michel entered the carriage. He seemed less upset than he had been earlier, but he was still very nervous.\n\'Now, Michel,\' said M. Poirot gently, \'we have to ask you a few things about last night. M. Ratchett went to bed - when?\'\n\'Soon after dinner, Monsieur - before we left Belgrade.\'\n\'Did you see anyone go into his compartment afterwards?\'\n\'His manservant, Monsieur, and his secretary. No one else.\'\n\'And was that the last time you saw or heard from him?\'\n\'No, Monsieur. He rang his bell at about twenty to one. I knocked, but he called out, \'Ce n\'est rieti. Je me suis trompe.\'\n\'And where were you at a quarter past one?\'\n\'Most of the time I was at my seat at the end of the corridor. Soon after one - I don\'t know when exactly - I went to the next carriage to talk to a colleague about the snow. Then Mrs Hubbard rang, and I spoke to her for a few minutes. Then I brought you some water, Monsieur.\'\n\'And later?\'\n\'At about two o\'clock M. MacQueen asked me to make his bed. The English Colonel from number 15 was there with him. When they had gone to bed, I sat at my seat until morning.\'\n\'Did you sleep?\'\n\'I don\'t think so, Monsieur.\'\n\'Did you see any of the passengers in the corridor?\'\nThe conductor thought for a moment. \'One of the ladies went to the toilet.\'\n\'Which one?\'\n\'I don\'t know, but she was wearing a red dressing gown. It had a Chinese-style picture on the back.\'\n\'And after that?\'\n\'You yourself opened the door and looked out for a second.\'\n\'Good,\' said Poirot. \'I wondered if you would remember that. Now, if the murderer came onto the train last night -\'\n\'There were no strangers on the train last night, Monsieur. The door to the next carriage was bolted on the inside. I opened the side door when we stopped at Vincovci at twenty past twelve, but I was standing there all the time. No one came through it.\'\n\'What about the side door beyond the restaurant carriage?\'\n\'That is always bolted on the inside at night.\'\n\'It isn\'t bolted now.\'\nThe man looked surprised for a moment. \'Perhaps one of the passengers opened it to look at the snow,\' he said finally. \'Monsieur, you do not blame me?\'\nPoirot smiled at him kindly. \'Of course not, my friend. Ah! I have one other thing to ask you. Another bell rang just after you knocked on M. Ratchett\'s door. Whose was it?\'\n\'Princess Dragomiroff\'s, Monsieur. She wanted her maid.\'\n\'You called the maid?\'\n\'Yes, Monsieur.\'\n\'That is all. Thank you for your help.\'\nThe conductor left the restaurant carriage and Poirot called Mr MacQueen for another interview.\nWhen MacQueen learnt that his employer had been the criminal Cassetti, he was very angry. \'How terrible that I helped an evil man like that!\' he cried.\n\'You seem to feel very strongly about this, M. MacQueen.\'\n\'Yes, I do. My father was on the legal team in the Armstrong case. He knew that Cassetti was guilty, but things went wrong in court and it couldn\'t be proved. Well, I\'m glad that he\'s dead - although I didn\'t kill him myself, you understand.\'\n\'Of course, of course. Now, I must check the movements of everyone on the train. What did you do last night after dinner?\'\n\'Well, I talked to some of the other passengers. At about ten o\'clock, I went into Mr Ratchett\'s compartment and he asked me to write some letters for him. Then I got into a long conversation with Colonel Arbuthnot.\'\n\'Do you know what time you went to bed?\'\n\'About two o\'clock, I think.\'\n\'Did you leave the train at any time?\'\n\'Arbuthnot and I got out at - what was the name of the place? - Vincovci. But it was bitterly cold, so we soon came back in.\'\n\'By which door did you leave the train?\'\n\'By the one next to the restaurant carriage.\'\n\'Do you remember if it was bolted?\'\nMacQueen stopped to think. \'Yes, I believe it was.\'\n\'And did you bolt it again when you got back on the train?\'\n\'I got on last, and no, I don\'t think 1 bolted it.\'\n\'When you were with Colonel Arbuthnot,\' continued the detective, \'the door of your compartment was open, I think. Please tell me who passed along the corridor after the train left Vincovci.\'\n\'The conductor - and a woman too, going towards the restaurant carriage.\'\n\'Which woman?\'\n\'I don\'t know. I just remember seeing a thin red dressing gown. She was probably going to the toilet.\'\n\'Did you see her return?\'\n\'Well, no, I don\'t remember seeing her.\'\n\'One more question. Do you smoke a pipe?\'\n\'No, sir, I don\'t,\' replied MacQueen.\n\'I think that is all at present. Thank you for your time. I would now like to speak to M. Ratchett\'s manservant.\'\nThe American left and the thin, pale Englishman arrived. The detective picked up his passport.\n\'You are the manservant of M. Ratchett - Edward Henry Masterman, age thirty-nine, a British citizen?\'\n\'Yes, sir.\'\n\'You have heard that your employer has been murdered?\'\n\'Yes, sir. A terrible crime.\'\n\'Please tell me when you last saw M. Ratchett.\'\n\'It was at about nine o\'clock last night, sir. I went to Mr Ratchett as usual, and helped him to get ready for bed.\'\n\'What sort of mood was he in?\'\n\'Not a good one, sir. He had just read a letter and I think he was upset about it. He criticised everything that I did.\'\n\'Was that unusual?\'\n\'No, sir. He lost his temper easily.\'\n\'Did M. Ratchett ever take any medicine to help him sleep?\' Dr Constantine moved forward a little to hear his answer. \'Always, sir, when he was travelling. He said that he could not sleep without it.\'\n\'Did he take it last night?\'\n\'Yes, sir. I poured it into a glass for him myself.\'\n\'Did you like your employer, M. Masterman?\'\nThe manservant\'s face showed no emotion. \'He paid me well, sir - but I\'m not very fond of Americans.\'\n\'Have you ever been to America?\'\n\'No, sir.\'\n\'And what did you do after leaving M. Ratchett last night?\'\n\'I told Mr MacQueen that he was wanted. Then I went back to my own compartment and read.\'\n\'You were in compartment number 4.\'\n\'Yes, sir, with a big Italian man.\'\n\'Does the Italian speak English?\'\n\'Well, a kind of English, sir. He\'s been in America - Chicago, I understand. We do not talk much. I prefer to read.\'\n\'What time did you go to sleep?\'\n\'I went to bed at about ten thirty, sir, but I didn\'t sleep. I had toothache.\'\n\'Did you not sleep at all?\'\n\'Yes, in the end. But not until about four in the morning.\'\n\'Did you leave your compartment during the night?\'\n\'No, sir.\'\n\'And the Italian?\'\n\'No, sir. He slept all night.\'\n\'One last question. Do you smoke a pipe?\'\n\'No, sir. I only smoke cigarettes.\'\n\'Thank you, Mr Masterman. I think that is all.\'\n\'Excuse me, sir, but the American lady, Mrs Hubbard, says she knows all about the murderer. She is very upset, sir.\'\n\'Then we should see her next, I think,\' said Poirot, smiling. Mrs Hubbard entered the restaurant carriage talking excitedly. \'Now who\'s in charge here, because I have some very important information. Very important.\'\n\'Please, Madame, sit,\' said Poirot. \'Then tell me everything.\'\n\'Well, I will tell you this. There was a murder on the train last night, and the murderer was in my compartment!\'\n\'You are sure of this, Madame?\'\n\'Of course I\'m sure! I was asleep, and suddenly I woke up. It was dark - and I knew that there was a man in my compartment. I was so frightened that I couldn\'t scream. I thought, \"I\'m going to be killed!\" It was so terrible - these nasty trains, and the horrible things that happen on them! And then I thought, \"Well, he won\'t get my jewellery,\" because I\'d hidden it under my pillow. Very uncomfortable, I can tell you. But that\'s not important. Where was I?\'\n\'You realised that there was a man in your compartment.\'\n\'Yes, well, I just lay there with my eyes closed for some time. Then I felt for the bell with my hand and pressed it to call the conductor. I rang and rang, but nothing happened. \"Maybe they\'ve already murdered everyone else on the train,\" I thought. Then finally the conductor came in. I switched on the lights, but there wasn\'t anyone there at all.\'\nJudging by Mrs Hubbard\'s voice, she thought that her last words were the most exciting part of her story.\n\'And what happened next, Madame?\'\n\'Well, I told the conductor what had happened, and he didn\'t seem to believe me. Clearly the man had got away, but the conductor only wanted to calm me down! Well, at the time I was worried that the man was the one from the next-door compartment. I asked the conductor to look at the door between the compartments, and of course it wasn\'t bolted. Well, I bolted it immediately, and put a suitcase against it too.\'\n\'And do you think the man in your compartment went into Mr Ratchett\'s compartment, or out into the corridor?\'\n\'How could I know that? My eyes were tight shut. Oh, if my daughter knew how frightened I was!\'\n\'Perhaps, Madame, you heard someone not in your own compartment but in the compartment of the murdered man.\'\n\'Certainly not! And I can prove it!\'\nFrom her handbag, she produced a small metal button.\n\'You see this? I found it this morning in my compartment.\' As she placed the button on the table, M. Bouc cried, \'This is a button from a conductor\'s uniform!\'\n\'It probably fell off Michel\'s uniform when he was helping Madame Hubbard last night,\' said Poirot.\n\'Why don\'t you people believe me?\' cried the American woman. \'At bedtime last night I was reading a magazine. When I switched off the light, I put the magazine on the floor near the window. Last night, after the man had been in my room, the conductor went nowhere near the window, but in the morning the button was on top of the magazine. What do you call that?\'\n\'I call that evidence, Madame,\' replied the detective seriously. \'Now, can I ask you a few questions?\'\n\'Of course,\' said Mrs Hubbard.\n\'You were nervous of this man Ratchett. So why had you not already bolted the door between the compartments?\'\n\'I had. Or at least, I had asked that Swedish lady if it was bolted, and she had said that it was.\'\n\'Why couldn\'t you see for yourself?\'\n\'I was in bed and my sponge bag was hanging on the door handle.\'\n\'When was this?\'\n\'About half past ten, I think. The Swedish lady had come to ask me for an aspirin.\'\n\'Do you remember the case of the Armstrong kidnap?\'\n\'Of course I do. I didn\'t know the Armstrongs personally. They moved in higher society than I. But I\'ve always heard that they were a lovely couple. Oh, that evil man Cassetti -\'\n\'Ratchett was Cassetti,\' said Poirot.\n\'Cassetti, on this train! I can\'t believe it! I must tell my daughter.\'\n\'Now, Madame, just one more thing. Do you have a red dressing gown?\'\n\'What an odd question! No, I don\'t.\'\nPoirot helped her towards the door. At the last moment he said, \'You have dropped your handkerchief, Madame.\'\nShe looked at the little piece of material that he was holding out to her. \'That isn\'t mine. It\'s much too small - mine are a sensible size.\'\n\'Ah!\' said the detective. \'It had an H on it. I thought it must be yours.\'\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37272, 11701),

(37278, '\nPart 4\nAn Open Door\nAs Mrs Hubbard left, M. Bouc said anxiously, \'I hope this button doesn\'t mean that Pierre Michel is the murderer.\'\n\'That button is interesting,\' said Poirot. \'But let us interview the Swedish lady before we discuss it.\' He looked through the pile of passports. \'Here we are. Greta Ohlsson, age forty-nine.\' M. Bouc asked the waiter to invite her in. The woman with a sheep-like face and fair hair entered. She looked quite calm. \'You know what happened last night?\' asked Poirot.\n\'Yes. It is terrible,\' she replied.\n\'You will understand, Mademoiselle, that I must ask everyone about their movements last night after dinner.\'\n\'Of course. Well, I spent most of the evening in my compartment, but I did go to see the American lady, Mrs Hubbard. She gave me some aspirin.\'\n\'Did she ask if the door between her compartment and Mr Ratchett\'s was bolted?\'\n\'Yes, she did. And it was.\'\n\'And after that?\'\n\'I went back to my bed, took the aspirin and fell asleep.\'\n\'Your compartment is this one?\' He pointed to the plan.\n\'Yes, I think so. I am sharing with a young English lady. Very nice. She has travelled from Baghdad.\'\n\'Did she leave the compartment during the night?\'\n\'No, I am sure she did not.\'\n\'Why are you sure if you were asleep?\'\n\'I wake very easily. She was sleeping in the bed above mine.\nI always notice when she comes down.\'\n\'Did you leave the compartment?\'\n\'Not until this morning.\'\n\'Do you have a red dressing gown?\'\n\'No, I do not. Mine is brown.\'\n\'Have you ever been to America, Mademoiselle?\'\n\'Sadly, no. I like the Americans. They give a lot of money to schools and hospitals in Turkey. Why do you ask?\'\nPoirot explained about the Armstrong case. Greta Ohlsson left the interview room shaking her head and crying, \'How can there be such evil in the world?\'\nPoirot spent some time writing notes. \'The conductor said that Mrs Hubbard\'s bell rang some time after 1 a.m.\'\n\'Yes, it seems quite clear that the murder happened at 1.15,\' said M. Bouc. \'That fits the evidence of the watch and the stories of the conductor and Mrs Hubbard. And I think I can guess who the murderer is. It is the big Italian. Italians always kill with a knife, and this one has lived in America. He and Ratchett probably worked in this kidnapping business together. Then Ratchett cheated him. The Italian wanted revenge. He sent threatening letters and then he killed him. Very simple.\'\n\'Simple except for the manservant with the toothache, who says that the Italian never left the compartment,\' said Poirot.\n\'Yes, that is a difficulty, but it will all be explained,\' said M. Bouc confidently.\nThe detective shook his head. \'No, it is not as simple as that, I fear. But let us hear what Pierre Michel can tell us about this button.\'\nThe conductor was called and shown the button.\n\'It seems certain,\' said M. Bouc, \'that the murderer passed through Mrs Hubbard\'s compartment and dropped that button.\' Michel was very upset. \'It is not mine, Monsieur! Look - my uniform has lost no buttons. I am innocent of this crime!\'\n\'Where were you when Mrs Hubbard\'s bell rang?\'\n\'In the next carriage, Monsieur. I was talking to a colleague.\' The colleague was called. His story agreed with Michel\'s. The buttons of all the other conductors\' uniforms were checked, and none were missing.\n\'Monsieur, do you see now? I am not guilty!\' cried Michel. \'Calm yourself, Michel,\' said M. Bouc. \'Think back to last night. When you ran to answer Mrs Hubbard\'s bell, did you see anyone in the corridor?\'\n\'No, Monsieur.\'\n\'That is no surprise,\' said Poirot. \'Mrs Hubbard lay with her eyes closed for some time after she realised that there was someone in her compartment. The man probably went out then. If the murderer was one of the passengers, he had time to get back to his own compartment before Michel arrived.\'\n\'We still have eight passengers to interview,\' said M. Bouc. \'Shall we see the Italian next?\'\n\'You think only of your Italian!\' laughed Poirot. \'No, we will see the Princess first. Michel, could you ask her to come in?\' Princess Dragomiroff looked even uglier than the day before, but intelligence and energy shone from her small, dark eyes.\nAs M. Bouc apologised for troubling her, she stopped him in her deep, clear voice. \'Murder is a serious matter, Monsieur. I am happy to help you in any way that I can.\'\n\'Thank you, Madame,\' said Poirot. \'You are Princess Natalia Dragomiroff, travelling to your home in Paris?\'\n\'Yes. My maid is with me.\'\n\'Please could you tell us your movements last night after dinner?\'\n\'Willingly. I went to bed straight after the meal. I read until eleven, then turned out the light. I was unable to sleep because of pains that I often have in my legs. At about a quarter to one I rang for my maid. She read to me until I felt sleepy. I am not sure exactly when she left me. After half an hour, perhaps.\'\n\'You have been in America, I suppose, Madame?\'\nThe sudden change of subject surprised the old lady.\n\'Many times.\'\n\'Did you at any time meet a family called Armstrong?\'\nHer voice shook as she said, \'If you mean Sonia and Robert Armstrong, then yes. Sonia was my goddaughter. Her mother, the actress Linda Arden, was a close friend of mine.\'\n\'Linda Arden is dead now?\'\n\'She is alive, but she sees no one. Her health is very poor.\'\n\'There was, I think, a second daughter?\'\n\'Yes, much younger than Mrs Armstrong.\'\n\'Where is she now?\'\nThe old woman looked at him in surprise. \'What connection do these questions have with the murder on this train?\'\n\'The murdered man was responsible for the kidnap and murder of Mrs Armstrong\'s child.\'\n\'Ah!\' Princess Dragomiroff sat straighter in her chair. \'Then this murder is a very happy event. You will excuse my strong opinion on the subject.\'\n\'Of course, Madame. Now we must return to my earlier question. Where is the younger daughter of Linda Arden?\'\n\'I honestly cannot tell you, Monsieur. I have lost contact with her. I believe she married an Englishman some years ago, but I\'m afraid I cannot remember his name.\' She paused for a minute and then said, \'Is there anything else, gentlemen?\'\n\'Just one thing, Madame. The colour of your dressing gown.\'\n\'I suppose you have a good reason for asking this. It is blue.\'\n\'That is all. Thank you for your help.\'\nCount and Countess Andrenyi were called next, but the Count entered the restaurant carriage alone.\nHe was a fine-looking man - tall, well-built, with a long moustache and dressed in an expensive English suit.\n\'Well, gentlemen,\' he said, \'what can I do for you?\'\n\'As you know,\' said Poirot, \'there was a murder here last night, and I must ask certain questions of the passengers.\'\n\'Of course. I am afraid, though, that my wife and I were asleep and heard nothing at all.\'\n\'Do you know who was murdered, Monsieur?\'\n\'The big American, I understand.\'\n\'Yes. His name was Cassetti. He was responsible for some terrible crimes in America.\'\nThe Count showed no sign of emotion at this news. \'That explains his murder, I suppose,\' he said.\n\'You have been to America perhaps, Monsieur?\'\n\'I was in Washington for a year.\'\n\'Did you know the Armstrong family?\'\n\'Armstrong - Armstrong - it is difficult to remember. There were so many names.\' He smiled. \'But returning to the murder, gentleman, what more can I do to help you?\'\n\'When did you go to bed last night, Monsieur?\'\n\'At about eleven o\'clock. We both slept until morning and noticed nothing. I am sorry we cannot help you in any way.\'\n\'Thank you, Monsieur.\'\n\'You won\'t need to speak to my wife. She can tell you nothing more than I have.\'\nPoirot\'s expression changed slightly. \'I am sure that is true,\' he said. \'But I must have a little talk with the Countess.\'\n\'It is quite unnecessary,\' said the Count.\n\'I\'m afraid it is necessary - for my report, you understand.\'\n\'As you wish,\' he said, and went to tell her.\nPoirot looked at the Count\'s passport. Travelling with wife, he read.\nName: Elena Maria Andrenyi Surname before marriage: Goldenberg Age: 20\nAn ink spot had been dropped on the page by a careless official. Countess Andrenyi entered the restaurant carriage. \'You wish to see me, gentlemen?\' she asked in perfect French.\n\'Thank you, Countess,\' said Poirot. \'I only need to ask you if you saw or heard anything unusual last night.\'\n\'No, nothing. I had taken medicine to help me sleep.\'\n\'Did you go with your husband to America, Madame?\'\n\'No, Monsieur. We were not married then. We have only been married a year.\' She smiled shyly. With her big, dark eyes and bright red lips, she looked very foreign - and very beautiful. \'Why did you ask me that?\'\n\'Detectives have to ask a lot of strange questions. For example, what colour is your dressing gown?\'\n\'It is a cream colour. Is that important?\'\n\'Very important. And does your husband smoke a pipe?\'\n\'No - cigarettes, but not a pipe.\'\n\'Do you speak English?\' he asked in that language.\n\'I speak a little, yes.\' Her accent was strong, but very attractive. \'And that is all,\' the detective said. \'You see, Madame, it was not so terrible.\'\nShe smiled and walked out of the carriage.\n\'That was not very useful,\' said M. Bouc. \'Shall we see the Italian now?\'\nPoirot did not reply for a moment. He was studying the ink spot on the Hungarian passport. Finally he looked at M. Bouc. \'We will leave your Italian for the moment, my friend, and interview the good-looking Englishman, Colonel Arbuthnot.\' When the Colonel arrived, Poirot said, \'You are travelling from India to Britain, I think. Why are you not going by boat?\'\n\'I chose to take the overland route for reasons of my own,\' said the Colonel unhelpfully.\n\'I see. You came straight through from India?\'\n\'I stopped for three days in Baghdad to visit an old friend.\'\n\'You met the young English lady there, perhaps - Miss Debenham?\'\n\'No, I did not. I first met Miss Debenham on the train.\'\n\'We think that M. Ratchett was murdered at a quarter past one last night. What were you doing at that time?\'\n\'I was talking to the young American - the dead man\'s secretary. We were in his compartment.\'\n\'Did you know M. MacQueen before this journey?\'\n\'No. We started talking yesterday and we enjoyed each other\'s company. I don\'t usually like Americans, but I like MacQueen. We had a long discussion about India, and America, and the world in general. I was quite surprised when I looked at my watch and found that it was a quarter to two.\'\n\'That is the time that you stopped this conversation?\'\n\'Yes.\'\n\'What did you do then?\'\n\'I walked back to my own compartment and went to bed.\'\n\'Now, Colonel, I want you to think back to your conversation with M. MacQueen. You got out at Vincovci?\'\n\'Yes, but only for about a minute. It was snowing very hard.\'\n\n\'So you came back in. You sat down again. You smoked - perhaps a cigarette, perhaps a pipe He paused for a moment. \'A pipe for me. MacQueen smoked cigarettes.\'\n\n\'The train started again. Did anyone pass the door after that?\'\n\'I don\'t remember anyone except the conductor. Wait a minute - there was a woman too, I think. She was wearing something red.\'\n\'Thank you. Have you ever been in America, Colonel?\'\n\'Never. I have no interest in going there.\'\n\'Did you ever know a Colonel Armstrong?\'\n\'Armstrong - Armstrong - I\'ve known two or three Armstrongs. Do you mean Selby Armstrong? Or Tommy?\'\n\'I mean Colonel Robert Armstrong, who married an American and whose only child was kidnapped and killed.\'\n\'Ah, I remember reading about that. But I didn\'t know him.\'\n\'The murdered man was responsible for that kidnap.\'\n\'Really? Then he deserved to die - although it\'s a pity that it wasn\'t done legally, through the courts, of course. You can\'t go around murdering people out of revenge, like Corsicans.\'\nPoirot looked at the Colonel thoughtfully. \'I have no more questions - unless you noticed anything unusual last night?\' Arbuthnot thought for a moment. \'No,\' he said. \'Nothing. Unless -\' He paused.\n\'Yes?\' said the detective.\n\'Well, it\'s nothing really. But when I got back to my compartment, I noticed that the door of the end compartment -\'\n\'Number 16?\'\n\'Yes, the door to it was not quite closed. The man inside looked out in a secretive way, then quickly closed the door. It seemed a bit strange.\'\n\'Yes,\' said Poirot doubtfully.\nWhen the soldier had left the carriage, Poirot stared into space for some time. Then he said, \'Colonel Arbuthnot smokes a pipe. In M. Ratchett\'s compartment I found a pipe cleaner.\'\n\'You think -?\' began M. Bouc.\n\'He was also in the same army as Colonel Armstrong. He said that he did not know him, but perhaps that was a lie.\'\n\'So it is possible that -?\'\nPoirot shook his head angrily. \'No, it is impossible that this Englishman, who believes in law and order, could push a knife into his enemy twelve times.\'\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37277, 11701),

Ratchett\'.\n\'I went to see Ratchett, and he showed me some threatening letters that he had received. He hired me for protection on his journey west. Well, my protection wasn\'t very good, was it?\'\n\'How had you hoped to protect him?\'\n\'I had planned to travel in the next-door compartment, but it was taken. Number 16 was in a good position, though. No one could reach Mr Ratchett\'s compartment without passing mine.\'\n\'You had no idea, I suppose, who the possible attacker was?\'\n\'Well, I knew what he looked like. Mr Ratchett described him to me.\'\n\'What?\' His three listeners almost jumped out of their seats.\nHardman continued. \'A small man, dark, with a high voice like a woman\'s. That\'s how Ratchett described him.\'\n\'Did you know that Ratchett was Cassetti, the Armstrong murderer?\'\nMr Hardman looked shocked. \'No, I didn\'t recognise him. I\'d seen photos of Cassetti in the papers, I suppose, but I wouldn\'t recognise my own mother in one of those photos.\'\n\'Please, M. Hardman, continue your story.\'\n\'There\'s not much to tell. I slept in the day and stayed awake watching the corridor at night. Nothing happened the first night and I thought the same was true last night. No stranger passed.\'\n\'You are sure of that, M. Hardman?\'\n\'Yes, I am. I\'m certain.\'\n\'Then I think we have finished. Thank you.\' Poirot offered the American a cigarette. \'But perhaps you prefer a pipe?\'\n\'Not me. It was nice to meet you, Mr Poirot.\' He took a cigarette and walked away.\nThe three men looked at each other.\n\'A small man, dark, with a high voice like a woman\'s,\' said M. Bouc thoughtfully.\n\'A description which fits no one on the train,\' said Poirot. He paused, then said with a smile, \'And now we will make M. Bouc happy. We will see the Italian.\'\nA man with dark skin and a pleasant, cheerful face was soon walking across the restaurant carriage towards them.\n\'Your name is Antonio Foscarelli, from Italy?\'\n\'Yes, Monsieur, but I have become an American citizen. It is better for my business.\' He smiled.\n\'You sell Ford motor cars?\'\n\'Yes, you see -\'\nA long explanation of Foscarelli\'s business methods followed, before Poirot could continue his questions. \'So you have lived in the United States for the last ten years?\'\n\'Yes, Monsieur. I remember the day that I left. My mother -\'\nPoirot interrupted him. \'Did you ever meet Mr Ratchett in America?\'\n\'No, but I met many people like him. On the outside, very polite, very well-dressed, but underneath - evil. In my opinion, Ratchett was a criminal.\'\n\'Your opinion is correct,\' said Poirot. \'Ratchett was Cassetti, the kidnapper.\'\n\'What did I tell you? I am good at reading people\'s faces. It is important in my work.\'\n\'You remember the Armstrong case?\'\n\'Not very well. It was a little girl, wasn\'t it? A terrible crime, but these things happen, even in a great country like America.\'\n\'Did you ever meet any members of the Armstrong family?\'\n\'I don\'t think so, but it is difficult to say. Last year alone I sold cars to -\'\nPoirot interrupted him again. \'Monsieur, please tell me what you did last night after dinner.\'\n\'With pleasure. I went back to my compartment. An English servant shares the compartment with me but he was out. Then he came back, but he wasn\'t interested in talking. \"Yes\", \"No\" - nothing else. He was very unfriendly. He read his book and I read mine. I smoked a cigarette or two. He had toothache, and he was making a lot of noise about it. I went to sleep, but I woke up a few times to the sound of his complaining.\'\n\'Did he leave the compartment at all during the night?\'\n\'I don\'t think so. When the door opens, the light from the corridor comes in very brightly and wakes you up.\'\nWith words of thanks, Poirot brought the interview to an end. \'Well, he has been in America for a long time,\' said M. Bouc when Foscarelli had left the carriage. \'He is Italian - Italians are good at lying and love using knives. I don\'t like Italians.\'\n\'That is very clear,\' smiled Poirot. \'But there is no evidence against this man. Italians use knives, yes, but in a fight, when they are angry. This murder was very carefully planned.\'\nHe picked up the last two passports. \'Let us see Miss Mary Debenham next.\'\nMiss Debenham entered the restaurant carriage calmly, dressed in a little black suit. She sat down opposite Poirot.\n\'Your name is Mary Hermione Debenham, you are English, and you are twenty-six years old?\' began Poirot.\n\'Yes.\'\n\'Now, Miss Debenham, what can you tell us about last night\'s events?\'\n\'Nothing, I\'m afraid. I went to bed and slept.\'\nPoirot looked at her thoughtfully. \'You are travelling from Baghdad to London, I believe.\'\n\'Yes.\'\n\'What have you been doing in Baghdad?\'\n\'I have been working as governess to two children.\'\n\'Have you ever been to America?\'\n\'America? No, never.\'\n\'What is your opinion of the lady who shares your compartment - Miss Ohlsson?\'\n\'She seems a pleasant, simple person.\'\n\'What colour is her dressing gown?\'\nMary Debenham looked surprised. \'A brown colour.\'\n\'And I noticed your dressing gown on the train to Istanbul. It is purple, I believe.\'\n\'Yes, that is right.\'\n\'Have you got any other dressing gown, Miss Debenham? A red one, for example?\'\n\'No, that is not mine.\'\nThe detective moved forward quickly, like a cat jumping on a mouse.\n\'Not yours? So you know that the red dressing gown belongs to someone else! Whose is it?\'\nThe girl moved back, a little shocked. \'I don\'t know,\' she replied. \'I saw someone wearing it last night in the corridor, but I didn\'t see her face.\'\n\'Was she tall or short? Fair or dark?\'\nShe had a hat on, so I couldn\'t see her hair. But she was tall and thin. It was a Chinese-style dressing gown.\'\nYes, that\'s right, Chinese.\' The detective was silent for a minute. Then he said to himself, \'I cannot understand. None of this makes sense.\' Looking up, he said to Miss Debenham, \'We do not need you any more. You can go.\'\nWhen she had left, M. Bouc stared at his friend with a confused look on his face. \'You think she is guilty, don\'t you?\' he said slowly. \'But why? She seems a very pleasant young lady - the last person in the world to be a murderer.\'\n\'I agree,\' said Constantine. \'She is a very calm person. She would not murder her enemy. She would take him to court.\'\n\'There is an unemotional, intelligent brain behind this crime. Miss Debenham fits the description of the murderer exactly.\' M. Bouc shook his head. \'You are wrong, my friend. That young woman is not a criminal.\'\n\'I have another reason to think carefully about her. I have not yet told you what I heard during my journey to Istanbul.\'\nHe told the two men about Miss Debenham\'s words to Colonel Arbuthnot on the platform at Konya.\nM. Bouc repeated the words thoughtfully. \'\"Not now. When it\'s all over. When it\'s behind us.\" That is certainly strange. It suggests that she and the Colonel are both responsible.\'\n\'Yes, but there are other people who tell us that they could not be the murderers. The stories of the Swedish woman and Mr MacQueen seem to prove that they are both innocent. No, that solution does not work. Ah well,\' continued the detective, picking up the last passport, \'let us see our last passenger - Princess Dragomiroff\'s German maid, Hildegarde Schmidt.\' When the maid entered, Poirot asked her gently, in German, about her movements the night before.\n\'I do not know anything, Monsieur,\' she said.\n\'Your employer sent for you last night, I believe. Do you remember the time?\'\n\'No, Monsieur. I was asleep when the conductor called me.\'\n\'Do you often go to your employer\'s room at night?\'\n\'It is not unusual, Monsieur. She does not sleep well.\'\n\'And did you put on your dressing gown to go to her compartment?\'\n\'That would not be right, Monsieur! I put on my day clothes.\'\n\'Although it is a very nice dressing gown - red, I think?\'\nShe stared at him. \'It is dark blue, Monsieur!\'\n\'Ah! My mistake! So, you went to the Princess\'s compartment. What did you do there?\'\n\'I read to her. Then I returned to my own compartment to get her an extra blanket, and finally went back to bed.\'\n\'Do you know what time that was?\'\n\'No, Monsieur.\'\n\'And you met no one in the corridor?\'\n\'No, Monsieur. There was nobody there except the conductor. Everyone was asleep.\'\n\'But you did see the conductor. What was he doing?\'\n\'He came out of one of the compartments, Monsieur.\'\nM. Bouc moved forward. \'Which one,\' he asked urgently. The maid looked frightened. \'One of the middle ones, Monsieur. Two or three doors from the Princess\'s.\'\n\'Please tell us exactly what happened.\'\n\'He almost ran into me as I was taking the blanket to the Princess. Then he apologised and continued down the corridor. A bell began ringing, but I do not think he answered it.\'\n\'This poor conductor,\' said Poirot. \'He had a busy night. First he had to wake you. Then there was that bell.\'\n\'He was not the conductor who woke me, Monsieur. It was another one.\'\n\'Another one? Would you recognise him if you saw him again?\'\n\'I think so, Monsieur.\'\nPoirot whispered something in M. Bouc\'s ear. M. Bouc went to the door to give an order.\n\'Have you ever been to America?\' the detective continued. \'Never, Monsieur. It must be a fine country.\'\nHe took a handkerchief from his pocket. \'Is this yours?\' There was a moment\'s silence as the woman examined it. Her face went a little red. \'No, it is not mine,\' she replied.\n\'It has the letter H, you see - for Hildegarde.\'\n\'Really, it is not mine. This is an expensive handkerchief, Monsieur, the handkerchief of a fine lady.\'\n\'You do not know which fine lady?\'\nPoirot noticed that there was a slight pause before she answered, \'I? Oh, no, Monsieur.\'\nM. Bouc now whispered in Poirot\'s ear. The detective said, \'The three conductors are coming in, Mademoiselle. Please could you tell me which one almost ran into you last night?\' The three men entered. Hildegarde Schmidt looked at them and immediately shook her head.\n\'No, Monsieur. None of these is the man that I saw last night. These are all tall, big men. I saw a small, dark man with a little moustache. When he said \"Excuse me\", his voice was weak, like a woman\'s. I remember him very well, Monsieur.\'\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37284, 11701),

(37290, '\nPart 6\nThe Sponge Bag\n\'A small dark man with a high voice,\' said M. Bouc when the conductors and Hildegarde Schmidt had left the carriage. \'That is the enemy that Ratchett described! But where is he now? He didn\'t leave the train, but he isn\'t on the train either.\'\n\'Like you, I am very confused,\' said Poirot. \'In this situation, it is always best to return to the facts that we can be sure about.\n\'Fact one: Ratchett, or Cassetti, was murdered in his bed last night, with twelve knife wounds in the chest. Fact two: his watch had stopped at a quarter past one -\'\n\'So that gives us a definite time for the crime,\' said M. Bouc. \'Not necessarily,\' said the detective. \'It is possible that the murder happened earlier or later than that time, and that the murderer has left us the watch as a false clue. There is also the information from Dr Constantine, that at least two of the wounds were made some time after Ratchett was already dead.\'\n\'And what about the man in the conductor\'s uniform?\' asked M. Bouc. \'He is fact three.\'\n\'Not so fast, my friend. We must first examine the evidence carefully. Hardman, the detective, spoke of this man. Should we believe him? I think we should, because his story - that he was hired by Ratchett - could easily be disproved by a quick phone call to McNeil\'s in New York. And we have other evidence that his story is true, from Hildegarde Schmidt. Her description of the man in the conductor\'s uniform matches Hardman\'s description exactly. And there is also the button found in Mrs Hubbard\'s compartment. So we have three separate pieces of evidence for this man with the high voice.\'\n\'Yes, yes, my friend,\' said M. Bouc impatiently. \'We all agree that he exists. But where did he go?\'\n\'Perhaps he is two people. I mean, he is both himself - the small, dark man feared by M. Ratchett - and a passenger on the train, looking so different that Ratchett did not recognise him.\'\n\'But the men on the train are all tall,\' said M. Bouc, \'- except the servant Masterman, and he is unlikely to be our murderer.\'\n\'The man may actually be a woman,\' said Poirot. \'That would explain the high voice.\'\n\'But it would not explain the wounds that did not bleed,\' said Dr Constantine. \'We must not forget those.\'\n\'I have forgotten nothing, Doctor, but I have not yet found the solution that I am looking for. Perhaps the woman in the red dressing gown, seen by several passengers including me, is our second murderer - the one who made those wounds, Doctor. If we believe the female passengers, nobody has a red dressing gown. So where is it now? And where is the conductor\'s uniform with the missing button?\'\n\'Ah!\' cried M. Bouc, jumping to his feet. \'We must search all the passengers\' luggage.\'\nM. Poirot stood up too. \'I can guess where you will find the uniform,\' he said. \'It will almost certainly be in the compartment of Hildegarde Schmidt.\'\n\'How -\' began M. Bouc, but he was interrupted by screams from the corridor. The door flew open and Mrs Hubbard ran in.\n\'It\'s too horrible!\' she cried. \'In my sponge bag. My sponge bag! A great knife - with blood all over it.\'\nThen she suddenly fell forwards and dropped heavily into the arms of M. Bouc.\nM. Bouc moved the woman to a chair, with her head on the table, and followed Poirot out of the door.\nDr Constantine called for a waiter. \'Keep her head like that,\' he said, then hurried after the other two.\nThere was a crowd of people outside Mrs Hubbard\'s compartment, wanting to see what the screams were about. Michel opened the door for the detective and his two friends. \'The knife is there, Monsieur. I have not touched it.\' Hanging on the handle of the door into the next compartment was a large sponge bag. Below it, on the floor, was a sharp knife, covered in dried blood. Poirot picked it up carefully.\n\'What do you think, Doctor? Did this knife kill Ratchett?\' Constantine\'s examination did not take long. \'Yes. All the wounds on Ratchett\'s body could be made with that knife.\'\n\'So,\' said M. Bouc, \'the man passes through this compartment on his way to the corridor. He notices the sponge bag and hides the knife inside it. Not even realising that he has woken Mrs Hubbard, he quickly leaves.\'\n\'Yes, no doubt,\' said Poirot, but his mind was clearly on other matters. He was staring at a door bolt thirty centimetres above the handle where the sponge bag was hanging.\nHis thoughts were interrupted by the tearful return of Mrs Hubbard. \'I\'m not going to spend another night in this compartment,\' she said. \'I wouldn\'t sleep in here again if you paid me a million dollars. Oh, if my daughter knew -\'\nPoirot said loudly, \'Your luggage will be moved immediately, Madame.\'\nMrs Hubbard\'s crying stopped. \'Really?\' she said. \'Then I feel better already.\'\nPoirot told Michel to move her luggage to compartment number 12, in the next carriage. The detective then showed her to her new compartment himself. She looked around happily.\nThis is fine,\' she said. \'And it faces the other way, so it feels quite different from my old compartment. Oh, I still can\'t believe that there was a murderer in there!\'\n\'The bolt on the door still confuses me, Madame,\' said Poirot. \'You were in bed, so you couldn\'t see it?\'\n\'That\'s right, because the sponge bag was there.\'\nPoirot picked up the sponge bag and hung it on the door handle. \'I see,\' he said. \'The bolt is just underneath the handle, so it is hidden by the sponge bag.\'\n\'Exactly. But the Swedish lady said that it was bolted.\'\n\'She made a mistake, I suppose,\' said Poirot.\n\'Well, it was rather stupid of her, I think.\'\nMrs Hubbard began to worry about the delay to the train. \'I can\'t possibly get to my boat in time. This is just too terrible -\'\nM. Poirot interrupted her before the tears returned. \'You have had a shock, Madame. Perhaps we should get you a cup of tea.\'\n\'A coffee would be better. Thank you.\'\nAs the coffee was brought to Mrs Hubbard, Poirot asked for permission to search her luggage. She agreed willingly, but nothing of interest was found. A search of Mr Hardman\'s compartment was no more successful, but in Colonel Arbuthnot\'s luggage he discovered a packet of pipe cleaners that were exactly the same as the one found at the crime scene.\nPoirot went next to the compartments of Count and Countess Andrenyi. As he entered, the Count was sitting near the door, reading a newspaper. His wife was curled up in a chair near the window. It appeared that she had been asleep.\nA quick search followed. \'Here is a label all wet on your suitcase, Madame,\' said Poirot as he lifted down a blue bag.\nShe did not reply, but stayed curled on her chair, showing no interest in the visitors.\nThe next compartment was shared by Mary Debenham and Greta Ohlsson. Poirot explained his purpose. \'After we have examined your luggage, Miss Ohlsson, perhaps you could visit Mrs Hubbard. We have moved her into the next carriage, but she is still very upset. It might help her to talk to someone.\'\nThe kind Swede wanted to go and see Mrs Hubbard immediately. She left her suitcase unlocked in the compartment for Poirot\'s search. This was quickly done and the detective turned to Miss Debenham. She was staring at him.\n\'Why did you send Miss Ohlsson away?\' she asked him.\n\'To help the American woman,\' he replied.\n\'A good excuse - but still an excuse.\' She smiled. \'You wanted to speak to me alone, didn\'t you?\'\n\'I do not plan as carefully as you think, Miss Debenham.\'\n\'Please - I am not stupid. For some reason, you have decided that I am responsible for this horrible crime.\'\n\'You are imagining things.\'\n\'No, I am not imagining things. Let\'s not waste time. Say what you want to say.\'\n\'As you wish, Mademoiselle. On the journey from Syria, we stopped at Konya and I went for a walk on the platform. I heard you say to Colonel Arbuthnot, \"Not now. When it\'s all over. When it\'s behind us.\" What did you mean by those words?\'\nShe said very quietly, \'Do you think I meant - murder?\'\n\'I am asking you what you meant.\'\nShe sat silently for a minute, lost in thought. Then she said, \'Those words had a meaning that I cannot tell you, Monsieur. I can only promise you that I never saw this man Ratchett in my life until I saw him on this train.\'\n\'You refuse to explain those words?\'\n\'I must, I\'m afraid. There was something that I had to do -\'\n\'And now you have done it?\'\n\'What do you mean?\'\n\'There was a delay before we arrived in Istanbul. You were very upset - you, who are always so calm. You lost that calm.\'\n\'I did not want to miss my connection.\'\n\'But the Orient Express leaves Istanbul every day of the week. Missing the connection meant a delay of only twenty- four hours. On this train, again we have had a delay - a more serious delay. But this time your behaviour is very different. You are not impatient at all. You are quite calm.\'\nMiss Debenham\'s face was red. She was not smiling now. \'You do not answer, Mademoiselle?\'\n\'I\'m sorry. What do you want me to tell you?\' For the first time she showed signs of losing her temper.\n\'Tell me why your behaviour is so different.\'\n\'I cannot tell you. There is nothing to explain.\'\n\'It does not matter,\' said Hercule Poirot. \'I will find out.\' He turned and left the compartment.\nIn the next compartment, Hildegarde Schmidt was waiting for them. After looking through her luggage, Poirot turned to M. Bouc. \'You remember what I said? Look here a moment.\' There was a brown conductor\'s uniform untidily placed inside the maid\'s suitcase.\nThe maid suddenly looked frightened. \'That is not mine!\' she cried. \'I have not looked in that case since we left Istanbul.\' Poirot touched her arm gently and said, \'Do not worry. We believe you. The man in this uniform had hoped not to be seen. After he ran into you in the corridor, he needed to hide his uniform. He saw that the door to your compartment was open, so he quickly took it off and threw it on top of your suitcase.\' He held up the jacket. A button, the third down, was missing. In the pocket was a conductor\'s key.\n\'With that, he could lock and unlock any door in the carriage,\' cried M. Bouc.\n\'Now we must find the red dressing gown,\' said Poirot.\nThe next compartment was Mr MacQueen\'s, and after that Masterman\'s and the Italian\'s. Nothing of interest was found in their luggage, and there were no more compartments to search.\n\'What shall we do now?\' asked M. Bouc.\n\'We have collected all the evidence that we can. We will go now to the restaurant carriage and think. But I will need cigarettes. I will meet you there in a few moments.\'\nPoirot returned to his own compartment to get cigarettes from his suitcase. As he opened the case, he sat down suddenly and stared. Placed tidily among his things was a red dressing gown with a Chinese picture on the back.\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37289, 11701),
(37314, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie\nPart 7\nWhich of Them?\nM. Bouc and Dr Constantine were talking together when Poirot entered the restaurant carriage.\n\'Well,\' said M. Bouc, \'this case makes no sense at all.\'\n\'I agree,\' said the doctor.\nPoirot lit a cigarette. \'But the evidence of the passengers was very helpful.\'\n\'I thought it told us nothing!\' cried Bouc. \'What did I miss?\'\n\'Take young MacQueen, for example. He told us that his employer, M. Ratchett, spoke no languages except English. Last night the conductor heard someone in M. Ratchett\'s compartment call out, \"Ce n\'est rien.Je me suis from pc.\" That was not M. Ratchett.\'\n\'It is true!\' cried Constantine excitedly. \'That is why you didn\'t want to accept the evidence of the watch. Those words came from the compartment at twenty-three minutes to one. Ratchett was already dead -\'\n\'And it was his murderer speaking,\' finished M. Bouc.\n\'You go too fast, my friends,\' said Poirot. \'We have no evidence that Ratchett was dead at that time.\'\n\'There was the cry that woke you.\'\n\'Yes, that is true.\'\n\'In one way,\' said M. Bouc, \'this discovery does not change things very much. The murderer killed Ratchett half an hour earlier than we first thought. He stayed in the compartment for half an hour, changed the watch hands to a quarter past one and left through Mrs Hubbard\'s compartment.\'\n\'But imagine that you are the murderer,\' said Poirot. \'Wouldn\'t you change the watch to a time when your presence in Ratchett\'s compartment was impossible? You wouldn\'t move the hands to the exact time that you left the crime scene.\'\n\'True,\' said Dr Constantine, a little confused.\n\'Perhaps it was the second murderer who changed the watch,\' said M. Bouc. \'The woman in the red dressing gown.\'\n\'It was too dark for her to see that the man was already dead, but she managed to find a watch in Ratchett\'s pyjama pocket and change the time blindly!\' said Poirot in disbelief.\nM. Bouc gave him a cold stare. \'And what is your explanation, my friend?\'\n\'At the moment I have none that makes sense,\' replied Poirot. \'But it is time to close our eyes and think. One or more of the passengers killed Ratchett. Which of them?\'\nFor a quarter of an hour, no one spoke. Poirot appeared to be asleep. Then suddenly his eyes opened and he said to himself, \'But why not? If so - well, that would explain everything.\'\nHe turned to the other men in the carriage and asked, \'Have you had any useful thoughts?\'\n\'Thoughts, yes, but nothing very useful,\' said the doctor.\nM. Bouc agreed.\n\'I myself have thought of an explanation that would cover all the facts of the case. I am not yet sure that it is the correct one, but I will soon find out. Before that, let us discuss some points of interest. Firstly, an ink spot on a Hungarian passport.\'\nM. Bouc looked at the passport of Count and Countess Andrenyi. \'Is this the spot that you mean?\' he asked.\n\'Yes. It seems to be fresh ink. You notice where it is?\'\n\'At the beginning of the Countess\'s name. But what -?\'\n\'Now, let us think back to the handkerchief. It is a very expensive thing, hand-made in Paris. It has an H on it, but it is not something that unfashionable Mrs Hubbard would buy, and it is certainly not the handkerchief of Hildegarde, the lady\'s maid. There are only two women on the train who might own a handkerchief like this. They are Princess Dragomiroff -\'\n\'Whose first name is Natalia,\' interrupted M. Bouc and Countess Andrenyi. Now, I wonder about that ink spot. Perhaps it was just an accident, but perhaps it is hiding a letter. Perhaps the Countess\'s name is not Elena but Helena.\'\n\'Helena!\' cried M. Bouc. \'That is an idea.\'\n\'And there is something to support that idea too. One of the labels on the Countess\'s luggage was slightly wet. Perhaps there too a change to her name was made.\'\n\'I am starting to believe you,\' said M. Bouc. \'But the Countess Andrenyi, a murderer? It is so unlikely.\'\n\'Now, let us imagine last night without the snow on the line. What happens? Well, the murder is discovered as the train enters Italy. The man in conductor\'s uniform is seen earlier-just before one o\'clock. We find a button in Mrs Hubbard\'s compartment and the uniform in the toilets. We read the threatening letters produced by MacQueen. We decide that the murderer got off the train at Brod, where it stopped at 00.58.\'\n\'You mean -?\'\n\'I mean that the murder was planned to seem like the work of someone from the outside, not a passenger. But the snow changed everything. It made it impossible to believe that the murderer had got off the train.\'\n\'And where does the handkerchief fit in?\'\n\'Be patient, my friend. Now, we return to the burnt note which included the words Daisy Armstrong. The murderer did not want us to read that letter. Why not? There can be only one reason. Someone on this train must be very closely connected to the Armstrong family, and the note would make that person look guilty. I think that person is Countess Andrenyi.\'\n\'But what connection could she have with the Armstrongs?\' cried M. Bouc. \'She says that she has never been to America.\'\n\'Yes, and she speaks only a little English, and she has a very foreign appearance. But this could all be an act. I am guessing that she is Linda Arden\'s younger daughter. Arden was not the actress\'s real surname. Perhaps she was really called Goldenberg, and the daughter met and married Count Andrenyi while he was working in Washington.\'\n\'But the Princess says that she married an Englishman.\'\n\'Princess Dragomiroff says that she cannot remember the name of the daughter\'s husband. Is that likely, when the Princess and the actress were such close friends?\'\nOne of the waiters interrupted them. \'Excuse me, Monsieur Bouc, but should we serve dinner now?\'\nM. Bouc looked at Poirot.\n\'I think dinner would be most welcome,\' said the detective. At dinner, Poirot shared a table with M. Bouc and the doctor.\nThe other passengers spoke little - even Mrs Hubbard. Poirot heard her say, \'I don\'t think I can eat,\' then watched as she ate everything that was offered to her.\nPoirot had asked the waiter to serve the Count and Countess Andrenyi last. All the other tables were empty when they finished their meal. As they stood up, Poirot stepped towards them. \'You have dropped your handkerchief, Madame,\' he said, passing the Countess the small square of material.\nShe looked at it quickly, then gave it back to him. \'You are mistaken, Monsieur. That is not my handkerchief.\'\n\'But it has a letter H on it - the first letter of your name.\'\nShe said calmly, \'My name is Elena. The first letter is E.\'\n\'1 think not,\' said Poirot. \'Your name is Helena, not Elena. You are Helena Goldenberg, the sister of Mrs Armstrong.\' There was complete silence for a minute or two. Both the Count and the Countess had gone white. Poirot said, more gently, \'You cannot deny it. We know.\'\n\'It is true, Monsieur,\' said the Countess. Her voice had changed. It was, for the first time, American.\n\'Why did you not tell me that this morning, Madame? And why did you change the name on your passport?\'\n\'I changed the name - it was not my wife,\' said the Count. \'We had heard that a handkerchief with an H on it had been discovered by the murdered man\'s body.\'\nHelena spoke in an emotional voice. \'The dead man murdered my niece, killed my sister and caused the death of my sister\'s husband - the three people that I loved best in all the world. I had such a good reason for killing him.\'\n\'And did you kill him, Madame?\'\n\'I promise you that I did not.\' she said quietly.\n\'It is true,\' said the Count. \'Helena never left her compartment last night.\' He paused, then continued, \'Imagine my position, M. Poirot. I did not want my wife, who I knew was innocent, to be taken to a police station, questioned, perhaps even judged guilty and sent to prison.\'\n\'If I am going to believe you, you must help me,\' said Poirot. \'Help you?\' repeated the Countess.\n\'Yes. The reason for the murder lies in the past - in the deaths of your sister and her family. Take me back into the past so that I can find the connection that explains everything.\'\n\'What can I tell you? They are all dead. All dead - Robert, Sonia, dear little Daisy.\'\n\'Susanne too. What nationality was she, Madame?\'\n\'Poor Susanne. She was French.\'\n\'Her surname?\'\n\'It\'s terrible, but I can\'t remember - we all just called her Susanne. A pretty, cheerful girl. She was so fond of Daisy. She helped the nurse to look after her.\'\n\'Who was the nurse?\'\n\'Stengelberg was her name. She too loved Daisy.\'\n\'You yourself - you were a young girl at the time - did you have a governess?\'\n\'Oh, yes, a very frightening woman. She was English - no, Scottish - a big, red-haired lady in her forties.\'\n\'What was her name?\'\n\'Miss Freebody.\'\n\'And there was no one else living with you?\'\n\'Only servants.\'\n\'Now, Madame, I want you to think carefully before you answer this question. Have you, since you were on this train, seen anyone that you recognised?\'\nShe stared at him. \'I? No, no one.\'\n\'What about Princess Dragomiroff?\'\n\'Oh, I know her, of course. I thought you meant anyone - anyone from - from that time.\'\n\'I did, Madame. Some years have passed, remember. The person may look very different now.\'\nShe thought for a moment. \'No - I am sure - there is no one.\' When the Count and Countess had left the carriage, M. Bouc cried, \'Excellent work, my friend. I never for one moment imagined that the Countess could be our murderer.\'\n\'So you feel sure that she is guilty?\' asked M. Poirot.\n\'Yes. The handkerchief proves it,\' said M. Bouc confidently. \'Oh, I am not sure about the handkerchief. There is another person who could be its owner, remember. I -\'\nHe stopped suddenly as Princess Dragomiroff entered the restaurant carriage. She walked towards Poirot and said, \'I believe, Monsieur, that you have a handkerchief of mine.\'\n\'Is this it, Madame?\' He showed her the one found in Ratchett\'s compartment.\n\'That is it. It has a letter N in the corner, for my name Natalia.\'\n\'But, Madame, it has the letter H, not N,\' said M. Bouc.\nShe gave him a cold stare. \'My handkerchiefs always have Russian letters on them. H is N in Russian.\'\nThere was something about this old lady that made M. Bouc feel very foolish.\n\'You did not tell us that this handkerchief was yours when we questioned you this morning,\' he said.\n\'You did not ask me,\' said the Princess. \'Your next question, I suppose, will be - why was my handkerchief lying by a murdered man\'s body? My reply to that is that I have no idea.\'\n\'Please excuse me, Madame, but why would we believe you?\' said Poirot. \'You have already lied to us about Mrs Armstrong\'s younger sister.\'\n\'And I would do the same again. Her mother was my friend.\nI believe in loyalty - to friends, to family - above all else.\'\n\'And in the case of the handkerchief, perhaps you are again lying to protect your friend\'s daughter.\'\n\'You think that the handkerchief is Helena\'s?\' She smiled coldly. \'Well, it is easy to prove that it is mine. I will give you the address of the people in Paris who made it for me.\'\n\'Your maid, Madame, did she recognise this handkerchief when we showed it to her this morning?\'\n\'Probably. She saw it and said nothing? Ah, well, then she too can be loyal.\'\nShe stood up and walked out of the restaurant carriage.\n\'But the Princess cannot be our murderer,\' said Dr Constantine. \'She doesn\'t have the strength to make the deepest wounds. Her arms are very weak.\'\n\'But the smaller wounds?\'\n\'Yes, those could be her work, I suppose.\'\nM. Bouc shook his head. \'Lies - and more lies. I cannot believe how many lies we were told this morning!\'\n\'There are many more lies to uncover,\' said Poirot cheerfully. \'I just need to make some more lucky guesses.\'\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37299, 11701),

(37300, '\nPart 8\nTwo Solutions\nColonel Arbuthnot was called again to the restaurant carriage. He came in, clearly annoyed, and said, \'Well?\'\n\'Firstly, I would like to show you a pipe cleaner.\' Poirot held it up. \'Is it one of yours?\'\n\'I don\'t know. I don\'t put a private mark on them!\'\n\'You are the only passenger who smokes a pipe. This pipe cleaner was found by the body of the murdered man. Can you tell us, Colonel, how it got there?\'\nColonel Arbuthnot looked surprised. \'I don\'t know,\' he said. \'I can only tell you that I didn\'t drop it there myself.\'\n\'Did you murder Mr Ratchett?\'\n\'I never even spoke to the man. Although, if I was the murderer, I wouldn\'t tell you, would I?\'\n\'Oh well. It doesn\'t matter.\' Again, the Colonel looked surprised. \'I really wanted to see you about something else,\' continued Poirot. \'Miss Debenham has told you that I heard her talking to you on the platform at Konya?\'\nArbuthnot did not reply.\n\'She said, \"Not now. When it\'s all over. When it\'s behind us.\" Do you know what those words meant?\'\n\'I must refuse to answer that question.\'\n\'You will not tell a lady\'s secrets?\'\n\'Exactly.\'\n\'Even when that lady is likely to be guilty of murder?\'\n\'That is crazy. Miss Debenham is not a murderer.\'\n\'Miss Debenham was the Armstrongs\' governess at the time that Daisy was kidnapped,\' said Poirot.\nThere was a minute\'s silence.\n\'You see, we know more than you think,\' continued Poirot. \'If Miss Debenham is innocent, why did she say that she had never been to America?\'\nThe Colonel coughed. \'Perhaps you are mistaken.\'\n\'No, I am not mistaken. Why did Miss Debenham lie to me?\'\n\'I suggest that you ask her. I still think that you are wrong.\' Poirot called to one of the waiters. \'Go and ask the English lady in number 11 to come here, please.\'\nThe four men sat in silence until Miss Debenham had entered the carriage. Her head was thrown back bravely. She looked very beautiful.\nHer eyes went to Arbuthnot for a moment - just a moment. Then she said to Poirot, \'You wished to see me?\'\n\'I wished to ask you, Mademoiselle, why you told us that you had never been in America. We now know that you were living in the Armstrongs\' house when Daisy was kidnapped.\'\nHer face changed for a second, then returned to its usual calm. \'The reason for my lie is easy to explain,\' she said with a smile. \'I have to work. Do you know how hard it is to get and keep a good job as a governess? If my name were connected with this crime, if my photograph were in the English newspapers, my reputation would be ruined. I would never work again.\'\n\'But if you were not guilty, there would be no problem.\'\n\'People remember names and faces - they do not remember who was guilty and who was innocent.\'\n\'It is always better to be honest, Mademoiselle. And you also kept secret the fact that Countess Andrenyi is Mrs Armstrong\'s younger sister.\'\n\'Countess Andrenyi? Really?\' She shook her head. \'It may seem unlikely, but I honestly didn\'t recognise her. Three years ago, when I last saw her, she was an American schoolgirl. She looks so different! It is true that, when I saw her, her face looked familiar. But I couldn\'t think who she was. After that, I didn\'t really notice her. I had my own worries.\'\n\'You will not tell me your secret?\' asked Poirot gently.\nShe replied very quietly, \'I can\'t - I can\'t.\' Suddenly her face was in her hands and she was crying. She seemed heartbroken.\nThe Colonel jumped up and stood uncomfortably beside her. He shouted at Poirot, \'I\'ll break every bone in your body!\'\n\'Monsieur!\' cried M. Bouc.\nArbuthnot was now talking to the girl. \'Mary, please -\'\nShe jumped up. \'It\'s nothing,\' she said. \'I\'m fine. You don\'t need me any more, do you, M. Poirot? If you do, please come and find me. Oh, what a fool I\'m making of myself!\'\nShe hurried out of the carriage, followed by Arbuthnot. \'Well, my friend,\' smiled M. Bouc at Poirot, \'another excellent guess!\'\n\'How do you do it?\' asked Dr Constantine in admiration. \'This time it was easy. Countess Andrenyi almost told me.\'\n\'What?!\'\n\'When I asked her governess\'s name, she said Freebody. You may not know, gentlemen, but there used to be a shop in London called Debenham and Freebody. With the name Debenham running through her head, Freebody was the first name that the Countess could think of. I understood immediately, of course.\'\n\'Nothing would surprise me now,\' said M. Bouc. \'Even if everybody on the train proved to be friends of the Armstrongs!\'\n\'It is certainly a most surprising case,\' said Dr Constantine? \'Now, let us see your Italian, M. Bouc,\' said Poirot. He asked the waiter to call Foscarelli to the restaurant carriage.\nThe big Italian soon arrived, looking very nervous. \'What do you want?\' he said. \'I have told you everything that I know.\'\n\'But now we want the true story,\' said Poirot. \'We already know it, but it will be better for you if you tell us yourself\'\n\'You sound like the American police,\' he said angrily. \' \"Be honest with us,\" they say, \"and the judges will be kind to you.\"\'\n\'Ah! You have had experience of the New York police?\'\n\'No, no, never. They could not prove anything against me - although they tried hard enough.\'\n\'That was in the Armstrong case, wasn\'t it?\' said Poirot quietly. \'You drove their cars for them?\' His eyes met the Italian\'s.\n\'If you already know, why ask me?\' the Italian said.\n\'Why did you lie this morning?\'\n\'For business reasons, and because I do not want to be questioned by the Yugoslav police. They hate Italians. They would just throw me in prison.\'\n\'Perhaps you deserve to be thrown in prison.\'\n\'No, no, I didn\'t murder that man. The long-faced Englishman can tell you that.\'\n\'Very good,\' said Poirot. \'You can go.\'\n\'That man was a pig!\' cried Foscarelli as he left the carriage. There were tears in his eyes. \'Little Daisy - what a lovely child! She loved to play in my car. All the servants thought she was wonderful.\'\nNext Poirot called Greta Ohlsson. She soon arrived, in tears, and fell back into the seat facing the detective.\n\'Do not upset yourself, Mademoiselle,\' Poirot said gently. \'You were the nurse who looked after little Daisy Armstrong?\'\n\'It is true,\' cried the unhappy woman. \'Ah, she was a sweet, kind-hearted little girl.\' For a moment she could not continue. \'I was wrong not to tell you this morning, but I was afraid - afraid. I was so happy that the evil man was dead, that he could not kill any more little children.\'\nPoirot touched her gently on the shoulder. \'I understand - I understand everything. I will ask you no more questions.\'\nThe Swedish lady moved slowly out of the carriage, her eyes blind with tears. As she reached the door, she walked into a man coming in. It was the manservant, Masterman.\n\'Excuse me, sir,\' he said to Poirot in his usual, unemotional voice. \'I thought I should tell you immediately. I worked for Colonel Armstrong in the war, sir, and afterwards in New York. I\'m sorry that I didn\'t tell you earlier.\'\nHe stopped.\nPoirot stared at him. \'Is that all that you want to say?\'\n\'Yes, sir.\' He paused; then, when Poirot did not speak, he turned and left the carriage.\n\'This is more unlikely than a murder mystery novel!\' cried Dr Constantine.\nM. Bouc agreed. \'Of the twelve passengers, nine have got a definite connection with the Armstrong case.\'\n\'Perhaps we can fit them all into our little collection,\' said Poirot, smiling. \'Maybe they are - I don\'t know-the Armstrongs\' gardener, housekeeper and cook.\'\n\'That would be too much to believe,\' said M. Bouc. \'They cannot all be connected.\'\nPoirot looked at him. \'You do not understand,\' he said. \'You do not understand at all.\'\n\'Do you?\' asked M. Bouc. \'Do you know who killed Ratchett?\'\n\'Oh, yes,\' Poirot said. \'I have known for some time.\'\nPoirot was silent for a minute. Then he said, \'M. Bouc, could you please call everyone here. There are two possible solutions to this case. I want to explain them both to you all.\'\nThe passengers crowded into the restaurant carriage and took their seats at the tables. They all looked nervous.\nThe conductor, Michel, asked M. Poirot if he could stay.\n\'Of course, Michel,\' the detective replied.\nHe stood up and gave a little cough. \'Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to find out who murdered Samuel Edward Ratchett - also known as Cassetti. There are two possible solutions to the crime. I will explain both solutions, and ask M. Bouc and Dr Constantine here to judge which is the right one.\n\'Mr Ratchett died last night between midnight and two in the morning. At half an hour after midnight, the train stopped because of the thick snow. After that time it was impossible for anyone to leave the train.\n\'Here is my first solution. An enemy of Mr Ratchett got onto the train at Belgrade. He was wearing a conductor\'s uniform and had a conductor\'s key, with which he opened Ratchett\'s locked door. He attacked Ratchett with a knife and killed him. Then he went into Mrs Hubbard\'s compartment -\'\n\'That\'s true,\' said Mrs Hubbard.\n\'He put his knife in Mrs Hubbard\'s sponge bag. Without knowing it, he lost a button from his uniform. Then he went out into the corridor, threw his uniform into a suitcase in an empty compartment and, dressed in ordinary clothes, left the train at Vincovci through the door near the restaurant car.\'\n\'But that explanation does not work!\' cried M. Bouc. \'What about the voice heard inside his compartment at twenty-three minutes to one?\'\n\'That was not Ratchett and not the murderer, but someone else. Perhaps someone had gone to speak to Ratchett and found him dead. He rang the bell to tell the conductor. Then, at the last minute, he changed his mind because he was afraid that people would think he was guilty of the crime.\'\nPrincess Dragomiroff was looking at Poirot strangely. \'And the evidence of my maid, who saw the man in uniform at a quarter past one?\' she asked. \'How do you explain that?\'\n\'It is simple, Madame. She recognised your handkerchief and invented her story to protect you.\'\n\'You have thought of everything,\' said the Princess.\nThere was silence. Then everyone jumped as Dr Constantine suddenly hit the table with his hand. \'But no,\' he said. \'No, no, and again no! That explanation does not work for so many reasons. You must know that perfectly well, Poirot.\'\n\'Then I must give my second solution,\' said the detective. \'But do not forget this first one too quickly. You may agree with it later.\'\nPoirot looked around the carriage before continuing, \'It was immediately clear to me that many of you were lying. To protect someone, Mr Hardman, you should spend the night in the person\'s compartment or in a place where you can see his door. Your method was completely useless - except for producing evidence that no one in any other part of the train could be Ratchett\'s murderer.\n\'Then there were Miss Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. On the platform at Konya, he called her Mary. A man like the Colonel does not use a woman\'s first name when he has only just met her. Clearly they were lying about their relationship.\n\'Mrs Hubbard also made a mistake. She said that her sponge bag was hanging on the handle of the door to Ratchett\'s compartment, and that it hid the bolt on the door. That would be possible in compartments 2, 4 and 12, for example - all the even numbers - because the bolt is just under the door handle. But in her compartment, number 3, the bolt is a long way above the handle and so it could not be hidden by a hanging sponge bag. Mrs Hubbard had clearly invented that story.\n\'The watch in Ratchett\'s pyjamas was interesting too. What an uncomfortable place to keep a watch! I was sure that it was a false clue. So was Ratchett murdered earlier, when a cry came from his room? I think not. He was so heavily drugged that he could not defend himself. He could not cry out either. I believe that the cry at twenty-three minutes to one - and the words in French - were planned to confuse me. MacQueen told me that Ratchett spoke no French. I was meant to think that Ratchett was killed at that moment.\n\'And the real time of the crime? I think Ratchett was killed at almost two o\'clock. And the murderer?\' He paused, looking at the passengers. There was complete silence.\nHe continued slowly. \'Everyone was proved innocent by another passenger - in most cases, a passenger who was unlikely to be a friend in an earlier life. MacQueen and Arbuthnot, the English manservant and the Italian, the Swedish lady and the English governess. \"This is very strange,\" I said to myself. \"They cannot all be guilty.\"\n\'And then, ladies and gentlemen, I realised. They were all guilty. It was impossible that so many people connected with the Armstrongs were travelling on the same train by chance. It could only happen if it was planned. That would also explain the crowded train at a time of year that is usually quiet. There were twelve passengers, after Ratchett\'s death. There were twelve knife wounds in Ratchett\'s body. In America, murder cases are decided by a group of twelve ordinary people.\n\'Ratchett had escaped punishment from the court in America, although no one doubted that he was guilty. I imagined a group of twelve people who decided, when the court case failed, to give him his punishment another way. And immediately the whole case became clear to me.\n\'Everything was explained - the strange wounds that did not bleed, the false threatening letters that were written only to be produced as evidence, the description of the dark man with a high voice that fitted none of the real conductors and could equally mean a man or a woman. I believe that everyone entered Ratchett\'s compartment through Mrs Hubbard\'s - and struck! No one could know which strike actually killed him.\n\'Every detail of the evidence was very carefully planned. The only possible solution appeared to be a murderer who joined the train and left again during the night. But then there was the snow - the first piece of bad luck. I imagine that there was a quick discussion, and everyone decided to continue with the crime. It would be clear that the murderer had to be one or more of the passengers, but they were still protected by each other\'s stories. They added some extra clues to confuse the case - a pipe cleaner, a lady\'s handkerchief, a woman in a red dressing gown. The dressing gown was probably Countess Andrenyi\'s, as there is no dressing gown in her luggage.\n\'MacQueen learnt that we had seen the word Armstrong on the burnt letter, and told the others. It was their second piece of bad luck. The position of Countess Andrenyi became worrying, and the Count changed her name on the passport.\n\'The plan was impossible without the help of Michel, the conductor. But if he was one of the group, then there were thirteen people, not twelve. I believe that the Countess, who had the strongest reason to kill Cassetti, was probably the one who did not do it. Her husband has promised me that she did not leave her compartment. I believe him.\n\'But why was honest Michel in this? He was a good man who had worked on the train for many years. Then I remembered Susanne, the Armstrongs\' French maid. Perhaps the unlucky girl was Michel\'s daughter. And the others? Arbuthnot was probably an army friend of Armstrong\'s, Hildegarde Schmidt the family\'s cook. Hardman probably worked as a detective on the case, or perhaps he had been in love with Susanne. And then there was Mrs Hubbard. She had a difficult job, because she was in the compartment through which everyone reached Ratchett. No one could say that they were with her. To play the part of this foolish old woman, a true actress was needed - Mrs Armstrong\'s mother, Linda Arden.\'\nHe stopped.\nThen, in a soft rich dreamy voice, very unlike the one she had used on the journey, Mrs Hubbard said, \'I always liked playing amusing characters. That mistake with the sponge bag was silly, though. We tried it on the journey east, but I was in an even numbered compartment then, I suppose.\'\nShe moved slightly and looked straight at Poirot. \'You have guessed so much, M. Poirot. But even you can\'t imagine what it was like - that terrible day in New York when Hector MacQueen told us that Cassetti had walked free from the court. I was crazy with sadness and anger - and the servants were too. Colonel Arbuthnot was there. He was Robert Armstrong\'s best friend.\'\n\'He saved my life in the war,\' said Arbuthnot.\n\'We decided then and there to give him the punishment that the court had failed to give him - death. Perhaps we were mad\nI don\'t know. There were twelve of us - well, eleven, because Susanne\'s father was in France, of course. Mary planned all the details with Hector.\n\'It took a long time to perfect our plan. Hardman managed to find Ratchett. Then Masterman and Hector had to get jobs with him. We had a meeting with Susanne\'s father. For Colonel Arbuthnot, it was important that there were twelve of us - it made it more correct, he thought. Michel was willing. We knew that Ratchett would come back from the East on the Orient Express, so this seemed the perfect opportunity.\n\'We tried to book every compartment in the carriage, but unfortunately one had been booked long before for someone from the train company.\' She smiled at M. Bouc. \'Mr Harris, of course, was invented - we didn\'t want a stranger in Hector\'s compartment. Then, at the last minute, you came, M. Poirot.\'\nShe stopped. \'Well,\' she said, \'you know everything now. But what are you going to do about it? If someone must be punished, can\'t you blame me and only me for the crime? It\'s unnecessary to bring trouble to all these other good people - poor Michel - and Mary and Colonel Arbuthnot - they love each other so much -\'\nPoirot looked at his friend. \'What do you say, M. Bouc?\'\nM. Bouc coughed and said, \'In my opinion, the first solution was the correct one - definitely. The murderer left the train at Vincovci. I suggest that we give that solution to the Yugoslav police when they arrive. Do you agree, Doctor?\'\n\'Certainly I agree,\' said Dr Constantine. \'I think I made some - er - rather silly suggestions about the medical evidence.\'\n\'Then,\' said Poirot, \'we have solved the case. My work here is done.\'\n- THE END -\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37299, 11701),

(37305, '\nPart 1\nWhat Happened to Holly Golightly?\nI sometimes visit places where I lived in the past - the houses and their neighborhoods. I like to see them again. There\'s a brown stone house in the East Seventies where, during the early years of the war, I had my first New York apartment. It was one room, crowded with an old red sofa and red chairs. The walls were dark and dirty from old cigarette smoke. The single window looked out onto a fire escape, a stairway that went down to the street. It wasn\'t a big place but it made me happy. It was my first home, and my books were there, and a box of pencils. Everything that a writer needed, I thought.\nI didn\'t write about Holly Golightly in those days. I\'m only writing about her now because of a conversation that I had with Joe Bell.\nHolly Golightly was another tenant in the old brown stone house, in the apartment below mine. Joe Bell had a bar around the corner; he\'s still there. Both Holly and I went there six or seven times every day, not for a drink - not always - but to make telephone calls. During the war few people had a private telephone. Joe Bell took messages for us. Holly got a lot of messages.\nOf course, this was a long time ago. I didn\'t see Joe Bell for years, not until last week. We weren\'t close friends but we were both friends of Holly Golightly.\nIt isn\'t easy to like Joe. He isn\'t married and he has a bad stomach. He\'s hard to talk to, except about his own interests. Holly is one of his interests; the others are dogs, a radio program that he\'s listened to every week for fifteen years, and musical theater.\nLate last Tuesday afternoon, the telephone rang and I heard Joe Bell\'s voice.\nI knew he was calling about Holly. He just said, \"Can you come over here? It\'s important.\" There was excitement in his voice.\nI took a taxi through the October rain and on the way I thought about Holly. Was she there? Was she in Joe\'s bar?\nBut there was no one in the bar except Joe. His place is very quiet. It doesn\'t have bright lights or a television.\n\"I want your opinion about something,\" he said. \"Something very strange has happened.\"\n\"Have you heard from Holly?\"\nJoe is a small man with a fine head of thick, white hair. His face is always a little red: now it went even redder. \"I didn\'t hear from her. Not exactly. That\'s why I want your opinion. I\'ll pour you a drink.\"\nAs I was drinking, he said, \"Do you remember Mr. I.Y. Yunioshi? A man from Japan?\"\nI remembered Mr. Yunioshi perfectly. He takes photos for one of the picture magazines. He lived in an apartment on the top floor of the old house at the same time as Holly and I.\n\"He came here last night. I haven\'t seen him for more than two years. And where was he for those two years?\"\n\"Africa.\"\nJoe looked at me, surprised. \"How do you know?\"\n\"I read it in a magazine.\"\nJoe gave me an envelope. In the envelope were three photos of a tall African man wearing a cotton skirt. There was a strange, wood carving of a girl\'s head in his hands. Her hair was very short. Her smooth, wooden eyes were too large and her mouth was too big. Was it a carving of Holly Golightly?\n\"What do you think of that?\" Joe asked.\n\"It looks like her.\"\n\"Listen, boy, it is her. Mr. Yunioshi knew her immediately.\"\n\"He saw her? In Africa?\"\n\"No, just the carving. But it\'s the same thing. Look.\" Joe turned over one of the photos. On the back was written: Wood carving, Tococul, Christmas Day, 1956.\nThis was the story. On Christmas Day, Mr. Yunioshi walked through Tococul with his camera. It was a small place, just a few houses. He was leaving when he saw the African.\nThe African was sitting outside a house, carving a piece of wood. Mr. Yunioshi liked his work.\n\"Show me more of your carvings,\" he said. Then he saw the girl\'s head.\n\"I want to buy this,\" Mr. Yunioshi said to the African.\n\"No,\" the African replied.\nMr. Yunioshi offered him a pound of salt and ten dollars, then offered him a watch, two pounds of salt, and twenty dollars. The African refused to sell. But for the watch and the salt he agreed to talk about the carving.\n\"\'Three white people rode here on horses in the spring. A young woman and two men. The men were sick, and for many weeks they slept in a small house far from here. The girl liked me and she slept with me.\'\"\n\"I don\'t believe that part of the story,\" Joe Bell said. \"I don\'t think she slept with him.\"\n\"And then?\" I asked.\n\"Then nothing,\" Joe said. \"She rode away with the two men. Mr. Yunioshi asked about her up and down the country. But nobody saw her.\"\nI wasn\'t happy with his story. \"Mr. Yunioshi\'s story doesn\'t tell us anything,\" I said.\n\"It\'s the only real news that we\'ve had about her for years,\" Joe said. \"I hope she\'s rich. If she\'s traveling in Africa, she\'s OK.\"\n\"She\'s probably not in Africa,\" I said. But I could imagine her there. It was a place that she would like. I looked at the photos again.\n\"If you know so much, where is she?\" Joe asked.\n\"Dead. Or in a hospital for crazy people. Or married. I think she\'s married. She\'s living quietly, here in New York.\"\nJoe thought for a minute. \"No,\" he said. \"I like to walk. I\'ve walked these streets for ten or twelve years. I look for her all the time and I never see her... Do you think I\'m crazy?\"\n\"No. But I didn\'t know you loved her.\"\nMy words hurt Joe and I felt bad. He picked up the photos and put them back into the envelope. I looked at my watch. I wanted to leave.\n\"Wait,\" Joe said. \"Of course I loved her. But I didn\'t want to touch her. I\'m almost sixty-seven and I still think about sex. But I didn\'t want to sleep with Holly. You can love someone but not want them in that way. You stay strangers, strangers who are friends.\"\nTwo men came into the bar. It was time to leave. Joe followed me to the door. \"Do you believe it?\" he asked.\n\"That you didn\'t want to touch her?\"\n\"About Africa.\"\nFor a minute I couldn\'t remember the story, just the thought of her on the horse. \"She\'s gone,\" I said.\n\"Yes,\" he said, opening the door. \"She\'s gone.\"\nOutside, the rain stopped, so I walked around the corner and along the street. I went past the old apartment building. The building stands next to a church in the middle of the block. It\'s smarter now, with a black painted door and new windows.\nI went up the steps and looked at the mailboxes. I knew none of the names, except Mrs. Sapphia Spanella\'s. She still lived there.\nOne of these mailboxes first introduced me to Holly Golightly.\nA week after I moved into the apartment, I noticed a card next to the mailbox for Apartment 2. It was smartly printed, but there was a strange message on it. It said: Miss Holiday Golightly, and, below that, in the corner, Traveling. I thought about it a lot: Miss Holiday Golightly, Traveling.\nOne night, long after midnight, I woke up. Mr. Yunioshi was calling down the stairs. He lived on the top floor, and his voice sounded through the house.\n\"Miss Golightly!\" he shouted, angrily.\nI heard a voice from the bottom of the stairs. It was young, amused, and silly. \"Oh, darling, I am sorry. I lost my key.\"\n\"You cannot ring my bell every night. Please get another key.\"\n\"But I lose them all.\"\n\"I work. I have to sleep,\" Mr. Yunioshi shouted. \"But you are always ringing my bell...\"\n\"Oh, don\'t be angry, you dear little man. I won\'t do it again.\" Her voice was coming nearer because she was climbing the stairs. \"Promise you won\'t be angry. Then you can take those photos that we talked about.\"\nI left my bed and opened the door a little.\n\"When?\" Mr. Yunioshi asked. His voice was excited now.\nThe girl laughed. \"One day,\" she answered. The words were unclear. She was drunk.\n\"Any time,\" Mr. Yunioshi said, and closed his door.\nI went out into the hall and looked down. She was on the stairs. I could see her but she couldn\'t see me. Her short hair shone in the light, yellow and brown. It was a warm evening, almost summer, and she wore a light black dress and black shoes. She was thin but healthy-looking. Her mouth was large and a pair of dark glasses covered her eyes. She wasn\'t a child - but she wasn\'t a woman, either. I learned later that it was two months before her nineteenth birthday.\nShe wasn\'t alone. There was a man behind her. He was short and fat, wearing a suit. His hand was on her back, holding her with his fat fingers. That made me uncomfortable - it just looked strange.\nWhen they reached her door, she looked in her purse for her key. Now he was kissing the back of her neck. She found the key, opened the door, and turned to him.\n\"Thank you for bringing me home, darling. That was kind.\"\n\"Hey, baby!\" he said. She was closing the door in his face.\n\"Yes, Harry?\"\n\"Harry was the other guy. I\'m Sid. Sid Arbuck. You like me.\"\n\"I love you, Mr. Arbuck. But good night, Mr Arbuck.\" She shut the door.\n\"Hey, baby, let me in. You like me. I paid the check for five people, your friends! So you like me, right? You like me, baby.\"\nHe knocked on the door quietly, then more loudly. Then he stepped back. Did he plan to break down the door? But he ran down the stairs, hitting the wall angrily with his hand. When he reached the bottom, the girl opened her apartment door.\n\"Oh, Mr. Arbuck...\"\nHe turned back to her, a happy smile on his face.\n\"The next time a girl asks for some money for the bathroom, darling, don\'t give her twenty-five cents!\" She wasn\'t joking.\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Breakfast at Tiffany\'s by Truman Capote', 37304, 11701),

(37319, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie\nPart 7\nWhich of Them?\nM. Bouc and Dr Constantine were talking together when Poirot entered the restaurant carriage.\n\'Well,\' said M. Bouc, \'this case makes no sense at all.\'\n\'I agree,\' said the doctor.\nPoirot lit a cigarette. \'But the evidence of the passengers was very helpful.\'\n\'I thought it told us nothing!\' cried Bouc. \'What did I miss?\'\n\'Take young MacQueen, for example. He told us that his employer, M. Ratchett, spoke no languages except English. Last night the conductor heard someone in M. Ratchett\'s compartment call out, \"Ce n\'est rien.Je me suis from pc.\" That was not M. Ratchett.\'\n\'It is true!\' cried Constantine excitedly. \'That is why you didn\'t want to accept the evidence of the watch. Those words came from the compartment at twenty-three minutes to one. Ratchett was already dead -\'\n\'And it was his murderer speaking,\' finished M. Bouc.\n\'You go too fast, my friends,\' said Poirot. \'We have no evidence that Ratchett was dead at that time.\'\n\'There was the cry that woke you.\'\n\'Yes, that is true.\'\n\'In one way,\' said M. Bouc, \'this discovery does not change things very much. The murderer killed Ratchett half an hour earlier than we first thought. He stayed in the compartment for half an hour, changed the watch hands to a quarter past one and left through Mrs Hubbard\'s compartment.\'\n\'But imagine that you are the murderer,\' said Poirot. \'Wouldn\'t you change the watch to a time when your presence in Ratchett\'s compartment was impossible? You wouldn\'t move the hands to the exact time that you left the crime scene.\'\n\'True,\' said Dr Constantine, a little confused.\n\'Perhaps it was the second murderer who changed the watch,\' said M. Bouc. \'The woman in the red dressing gown.\'\n\'It was too dark for her to see that the man was already dead, but she managed to find a watch in Ratchett\'s pyjama pocket and change the time blindly!\' said Poirot in disbelief.\nM. Bouc gave him a cold stare. \'And what is your explanation, my friend?\'\n\'At the moment I have none that makes sense,\' replied Poirot. \'But it is time to close our eyes and think. One or more of the passengers killed Ratchett. Which of them?\'\nFor a quarter of an hour, no one spoke. Poirot appeared to be asleep. Then suddenly his eyes opened and he said to himself, \'But why not? If so - well, that would explain everything.\'\nHe turned to the other men in the carriage and asked, \'Have you had any useful thoughts?\'\n\'Thoughts, yes, but nothing very useful,\' said the doctor.\nM. Bouc agreed.\n\'I myself have thought of an explanation that would cover all the facts of the case. I am not yet sure that it is the correct one, but I will soon find out. Before that, let us discuss some points of interest. Firstly, an ink spot on a Hungarian passport.\'\nM. Bouc looked at the passport of Count and Countess Andrenyi. \'Is this the spot that you mean?\' he asked.\n\'Yes. It seems to be fresh ink. You notice where it is?\'\n\'At the beginning of the Countess\'s name. But what -?\'\n\'Now, let us think back to the handkerchief. It is a very expensive thing, hand-made in Paris. It has an H on it, but it is not something that unfashionable Mrs Hubbard would buy, and it is certainly not the handkerchief of Hildegarde, the lady\'s maid. There are only two women on the train who might own a handkerchief like this. They are Princess Dragomiroff -\'\n\'Whose first name is Natalia,\' interrupted M. Bouc and Countess Andrenyi. Now, I wonder about that ink spot. Perhaps it was just an accident, but perhaps it is hiding a letter. Perhaps the Countess\'s name is not Elena but Helena.\'\n\'Helena!\' cried M. Bouc. \'That is an idea.\'\n\'And there is something to support that idea too. One of the labels on the Countess\'s luggage was slightly wet. Perhaps there too a change to her name was made.\'\n\'I am starting to believe you,\' said M. Bouc. \'But the Countess Andrenyi, a murderer? It is so unlikely.\'\n\'Now, let us imagine last night without the snow on the line. What happens? Well, the murder is discovered as the train enters Italy. The man in conductor\'s uniform is seen earlier-just before one o\'clock. We find a button in Mrs Hubbard\'s compartment and the uniform in the toilets. We read the threatening letters produced by MacQueen. We decide that the murderer got off the train at Brod, where it stopped at 00.58.\'\n\'You mean -?\'\n\'I mean that the murder was planned to seem like the work of someone from the outside, not a passenger. But the snow changed everything. It made it impossible to believe that the murderer had got off the train.\'\n\'And where does the handkerchief fit in?\'\n\'Be patient, my friend. Now, we return to the burnt note which included the words Daisy Armstrong. The murderer did not want us to read that letter. Why not? There can be only one reason. Someone on this train must be very closely connected to the Armstrong family, and the note would make that person look guilty. I think that person is Countess Andrenyi.\'\n\'But what connection could she have with the Armstrongs?\' cried M. Bouc. \'She says that she has never been to America.\'\n\'Yes, and she speaks only a little English, and she has a very foreign appearance. But this could all be an act. I am guessing that she is Linda Arden\'s younger daughter. Arden was not the actress\'s real surname. Perhaps she was really called Goldenberg, and the daughter met and married Count Andrenyi while he was working in Washington.\'\n\'But the Princess says that she married an Englishman.\'\n\'Princess Dragomiroff says that she cannot remember the name of the daughter\'s husband. Is that likely, when the Princess and the actress were such close friends?\'\nOne of the waiters interrupted them. \'Excuse me, Monsieur Bouc, but should we serve dinner now?\'\nM. Bouc looked at Poirot.\n\'I think dinner would be most welcome,\' said the detective. At dinner, Poirot shared a table with M. Bouc and the doctor.\nThe other passengers spoke little - even Mrs Hubbard. Poirot heard her say, \'I don\'t think I can eat,\' then watched as she ate everything that was offered to her.\nPoirot had asked the waiter to serve the Count and Countess Andrenyi last. All the other tables were empty when they finished their meal. As they stood up, Poirot stepped towards them. \'You have dropped your handkerchief, Madame,\' he said, passing the Countess the small square of material.\nShe looked at it quickly, then gave it back to him. \'You are mistaken, Monsieur. That is not my handkerchief.\'\n\'But it has a letter H on it - the first letter of your name.\'\nShe said calmly, \'My name is Elena. The first letter is E.\'\n\'1 think not,\' said Poirot. \'Your name is Helena, not Elena. You are Helena Goldenberg, the sister of Mrs Armstrong.\' There was complete silence for a minute or two. Both the Count and the Countess had gone white. Poirot said, more gently, \'You cannot deny it. We know.\'\n\'It is true, Monsieur,\' said the Countess. Her voice had changed. It was, for the first time, American.\n\'Why did you not tell me that this morning, Madame? And why did you change the name on your passport?\'\n\'I changed the name - it was not my wife,\' said the Count. \'We had heard that a handkerchief with an H on it had been discovered by the murdered man\'s body.\'\nHelena spoke in an emotional voice. \'The dead man murdered my niece, killed my sister and caused the death of my sister\'s husband - the three people that I loved best in all the world. I had such a good reason for killing him.\'\n\'And did you kill him, Madame?\'\n\'I promise you that I did not.\' she said quietly.\n\'It is true,\' said the Count. \'Helena never left her compartment last night.\' He paused, then continued, \'Imagine my position, M. Poirot. I did not want my wife, who I knew was innocent, to be taken to a police station, questioned, perhaps even judged guilty and sent to prison.\'\n\'If I am going to believe you, you must help me,\' said Poirot. \'Help you?\' repeated the Countess.\n\'Yes. The reason for the murder lies in the past - in the deaths of your sister and her family. Take me back into the past so that I can find the connection that explains everything.\'\n\'What can I tell you? They are all dead. All dead - Robert, Sonia, dear little Daisy.\'\n\'Susanne too. What nationality was she, Madame?\'\n\'Poor Susanne. She was French.\'\n\'Her surname?\'\n\'It\'s terrible, but I can\'t remember - we all just called her Susanne. A pretty, cheerful girl. She was so fond of Daisy. She helped the nurse to look after her.\'\n\'Who was the nurse?\'\n\'Stengelberg was her name. She too loved Daisy.\'\n\'You yourself - you were a young girl at the time - did you have a governess?\'\n\'Oh, yes, a very frightening woman. She was English - no, Scottish - a big, red-haired lady in her forties.\'\n\'What was her name?\'\n\'Miss Freebody.\'\n\'And there was no one else living with you?\'\n\'Only servants.\'\n\'Now, Madame, I want you to think carefully before you answer this question. Have you, since you were on this train, seen anyone that you recognised?\'\nShe stared at him. \'I? No, no one.\'\n\'What about Princess Dragomiroff?\'\n\'Oh, I know her, of course. I thought you meant anyone - anyone from - from that time.\'\n\'I did, Madame. Some years have passed, remember. The person may look very different now.\'\nShe thought for a moment. \'No - I am sure - there is no one.\' When the Count and Countess had left the carriage, M. Bouc cried, \'Excellent work, my friend. I never for one moment imagined that the Countess could be our murderer.\'\n\'So you feel sure that she is guilty?\' asked M. Poirot.\n\'Yes. The handkerchief proves it,\' said M. Bouc confidently. \'Oh, I am not sure about the handkerchief. There is another person who could be its owner, remember. I -\'\nHe stopped suddenly as Princess Dragomiroff entered the restaurant carriage. She walked towards Poirot and said, \'I believe, Monsieur, that you have a handkerchief of mine.\'\n\'Is this it, Madame?\' He showed her the one found in Ratchett\'s compartment.\n\'That is it. It has a letter N in the corner, for my name Natalia.\'\n\'But, Madame, it has the letter H, not N,\' said M. Bouc.\nShe gave him a cold stare. \'My handkerchiefs always have Russian letters on them. H is N in Russian.\'\nThere was something about this old lady that made M. Bouc feel very foolish.\n\'You did not tell us that this handkerchief was yours when we questioned you this morning,\' he said.\n\'You did not ask me,\' said the Princess. \'Your next question, I suppose, will be - why was my handkerchief lying by a murdered man\'s body? My reply to that is that I have no idea.\'\n\'Please excuse me, Madame, but why would we believe you?\' said Poirot. \'You have already lied to us about Mrs Armstrong\'s younger sister.\'\n\'And I would do the same again. Her mother was my friend.\nI believe in loyalty - to friends, to family - above all else.\'\n\'And in the case of the handkerchief, perhaps you are again lying to protect your friend\'s daughter.\'\n\'You think that the handkerchief is Helena\'s?\' She smiled coldly. \'Well, it is easy to prove that it is mine. I will give you the address of the people in Paris who made it for me.\'\n\'Your maid, Madame, did she recognise this handkerchief when we showed it to her this morning?\'\n\'Probably. She saw it and said nothing? Ah, well, then she too can be loyal.\'\nShe stood up and walked out of the restaurant carriage.\n\'But the Princess cannot be our murderer,\' said Dr Constantine. \'She doesn\'t have the strength to make the deepest wounds. Her arms are very weak.\'\n\'But the smaller wounds?\'\n\'Yes, those could be her work, I suppose.\'\nM. Bouc shook his head. \'Lies - and more lies. I cannot believe how many lies we were told this morning!\'\n\'There are many more lies to uncover,\' said Poirot cheerfully. \'I just need to make some more lucky guesses.\'\n', 1, 1, 0, 'Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie', 37318, 11701),

But Mr Fortescue - he said it was the tea...\'\n\nA short while later Dr Isaacs, a local doctor the office boy had found and Sir Edwin Sandeman, Mr Fortescue\'s doctor, met in the lift.\n\n \n\nDetective Inspector Neele sat behind Mr Fortescue\'s desk. One of his officers sat quietly against the wall near the door with a notebook. Inspector Neele looked like an ordinary man, but his way of thinking was very imaginative.\n\n Miss Griffith had just left, after giving him an exact report of the morning\'s events. Inspector Neele thought of possible reasons why the head typist could have poisoned her employer\'s tea, and rejected them as unlikely, because Miss Griffith was (a) not the type of person to be a poisoner, (b) not in love with her employer, (c) not a woman who held grudges.\n\nIt was possible, of course, that Mr Fortescue\'s sudden illness had a natural cause, but neither Dr Isaacs nor Sir Edwin Sandeman had thought so.\n\n Miss Grosvenor now came in and said at once, \'I didn\'t do it! There wasn\'t anything wrong with the tea!\'\n\n Inspector Neele thought of a possible reason why Miss Grosvenor might have poisoned Mr Fortescue: perhaps a love affair that had gone wrong?\n\n \'I see,\' said Inspector Neele. \'Your name and address, please?\'\n\n \'Irene Grosvenor, 14 Rushmoor Road, Muswell Hill.\'\n\n No love affair, Neele said to himself. The address was a respectable one and she probably lived there with her parents. Inspector Neele questioned her about how she had made Mr Fortescue\'s tea. The cup, saucer and teapot had already been sent for analysis. Irene Grosvenor and only Irene Grosvenor had touched that cup, saucer and teapot. The kettle had been refilled from the tap in the small kitchen by Miss Grosvenor.\n\n \'And the tea itself?\' asked Neele.\n\n \'It was Mr Fortescue\'s own special China tea. We keep it in my room.\'\n\n Inspector Neele asked about sugar and heard that Mr Fortescue didn\'t take sugar. The telephone rang and Inspector Neele picked it up and spoke. \'Sergeant Hay?\' He nodded to Miss Grosvenor and said, \'That\'s all for now, thank you.\' She went out of the room quickly.\n\n \'He died five minutes ago, you say?\' Neele said into the phone. Sergeant Hay had gone to St Jude\'s Hospital, where Mr Fortescue had been taken. Twelve forty-three, he wrote in his notebook. Hay then said that Dr Bernsdorff would like to speak to Inspector Neele. A moment later a loud voice made Neele take the telephone away from his ear.\n\n \'Hello, you old crime hunter!\' Inspector Neele and Dr Bernsdorff of St Jude\'s had worked together on a case of poisoning a year ago and had become friends.\n\n \'Mr Fortescue\'s dead, I hear, doc. And the cause of death?\'\n\n \'There will have to be an autopsy, naturally. It\'s a very interesting case. Very interesting indeed.\'\n\n \'You don\'t think it was a natural death?\' asked Neele.\n\n \'Not a chance of it.\'\n\n\'He was poisoned?\'\n\n \'Definitely. And I\'m almost sure what the poison was. Taxine, my boy. Taxine.\'\n\n \'Taxine? I\'ve never heard of it,\' said Neele.\n\n \'It\'s really very unusual! I don\'t think I would have thought of it myself if I hadn\'t had a case only three weeks ago. A couple of kids playing dolls\' tea parties pulled some berries off a yew tree and made tea with them. Extremely poisonous, but I don\'t think I\'ve heard of a case where it was used deliberately. It really is most interesting and unusual. You have no idea, Neele, how boring it is when weed killer is used all the time. Interesting for you, too, I would think!\'\n\n \'So enjoyable for everyone, is that the idea? Except for the victim. Did he say anything before he died? \'\n\n \'He said that he had been given something in his tea at the office - but that\'s nonsense, because Taxine doesn\'t work that fast. It takes two or three hours to work. And if he had eaten a big breakfast, it would take even longer.\'\n\n \'Breakfast,\' said Inspector Neele thoughtfully. \'Thanks, doctor. I\'d like to speak to my Sergeant again, if you don\'t mind.\' Moments later Sergeant Hay said urgently, \'Sir. The suit the victim was wearing - I checked the contents of the pockets. There were the usual things - handkerchief, keys, change, wallet - but there was one thing that\'s really strange. The right-hand pocket of his jacket had grain in it. It looked like rye to me. Quite a lot of it.\' Inspector Neele got up and went into the typists\' office. \'Miss Griffith? Can I have a word with you?\'\n\n Miss Griffith followed Neele back into Mr Fortescue\'s office and he said, \'I have heard from St Jude\'s Hospital. Mr Rex Fortescue died at 12.43.\'\n\n \'I was afraid he was very ill,\' she said.\n\n She was not, Neele noted, at all upset. \'Will you please give me the details of his home and family?\'\n\n \'Of course. I tried to speak to Mrs Fortescue, but it seems she is out playing golf. They do not know where she is playing, but they will tell her that Mr Fortescue is in hospital when she returns. I\'ve written down the telephone number for you, but they live at Baydon Heath and the name of the house is Yewtree Lodge...\'\n\n \'What?\' exclaimed Neele, immediately connecting the name of the house with the poison that had been used.\n\n Miss Griffith looked at him with interest, but Inspector Neele said no more on the subject. \'Can you give me details of his family?\'\n\n\'Mrs Adele Fortescue is his second wife. She is much younger than he is. The first Mrs Fortescue has been dead a long time. There are two sons and a daughter from the first marriage. The daughter, Elaine, lives at home and so does the elder son, Percival, who is a partner in the firm. He is away in the north of England today on business. They are expecting him to return tomorrow.\'\n\n \'When did he go away?\'\n\n\'The day before yesterday.\'\n\n \'And the second son?\'\n\n \'Because of a disagreement with his father, Lance Fortescue lives abroad.\'\n\n \'Are both sons married?\'\n\n \'Yes. Mr Percival has been married for three years. He and his wife, Jennifer, are moving into their own house soon.\'\n\n \'You were not able to get in touch with Jennifer Fortescue either, when you rang?\'\n\n \'She had gone to London for the day.\' Miss Griffith went on, \'Mr Lance got married less than a year ago. To the widow of Lord Frederick Anstice. I expect you\'ve seen pictures of Mrs Patricia in magazines such as the Tatler - with horses, you know. And at horse races.\'\n\n Neele assumed that the disagreement with his father was because young Lance Fortescue had been guilty of some bad behaviour, possibly in business. And now he was married to the widow of Lord Frederick Anstice, a man who had killed himself rather than face an inquiry about his racehorses.\n\n Neele picked up the phone and dialled and soon a man\'s voice said, \'Baydon Heath 3400.\'\n\n \'I want to speak to Mrs Adele Fortescue or Miss Elaine Fortescue.\'\n\n \'They aren\'t in, either of them.\'\n\n Are you the butler?\'\n\n \'That\'s right.\'\n\n \'Is there anyone in the house I can speak to about Mr Rex Fortescue\'s illness?\'\n\n \'Well, there\'s Miss Dove, the housekeeper.\'\n\n \'I\'ll speak to Miss Dove, please.\'\n\n A minute or two later a woman\'s voice spoke. \'This is Miss Dove.\' The voice was low and musical.\n\n \'I am sorry to have to tell you, Miss Dove, that Mr Rex Fortescue died a short time ago. I need to contact his relatives...\'\n\n \'Of course,\' she said, her voice calm. \'The person you really want to speak to is Mr Percival Fortescue. You might find him at the Midland Hotel in Manchester or possibly at the Grand in Leicester. Mrs Adele Fortescue will be home for dinner and she may be in to tea. It will be a great shock to her. Mr Fortescue was well when he left here this morning. What was it? His heart? \'\n\n \'Did he have heart trouble?\' Neele asked.\n\n \'No, but as it was so sudden...\' She broke off. \'Are you speaking from St Jude\'s Hospital?\'\n\n \'No, Miss Dove, I\'m speaking from Mr Fortescue\'s office. I am Detective Inspector Neele and I will be coming down to see you as soon as I can get there.\'\n\n \'Detective Inspector? Do you mean... what do you mean?\'\n\n \'Miss Dove, when there is a sudden death, we are called to the scene, especially when the deceased hadn\'t seen a doctor lately - he hadn\'t, had he?\'\n\n \'No. Mr Percival made an appointment twice for him, but he refused to go. He was quite unreasonable - they were all worried...\' She broke off and then continued as calmly as before. \'If Mrs Fortescue returns to the house before you arrive, what do you want me to tell her?\'\n\n What a practical and sensible woman she is, thought Inspector Neele. Aloud he said, \'Just tell her that in a case of sudden death we have to make a few inquiries. Routine inquiries.\'', 1, 1, 0, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie', 30836, 11701);

(39159, 'Neele looked at Miss Griffith seriously. \'So they wanted him to see a doctor. You didn\'t tell me that.\'\n\n\'I didn\'t think of it,\' said Miss Griffith. \'He never seemed to me really ill - just unlike himself. Once or twice I thought he had been drinking... For most of the time I\'ve been here he was always very secretive about his business affairs, but recently he\'d been talking openly about them, and spending large amounts of money - which wasn\'t like him. It seemed like he was looking forward to something exciting. And some very strange-looking people came to see him on business. It worried Mr Percival. Mr Fortescue was doing a lot of things that Mr Percival thought were unwise. But suddenly his father didn\'t listen to him any more and Mr Percival was very upset.\'\n\n\'And they had a real fight about it all?\' Inspector Neele asked. \'I don\'t know about a fight, but once, Mr Fortescue came into the typists\' room with Mr Percival and he called him names and swore at him. He said Mr Percival was too scared to expand the business in a big way. He said, \"I shall bring Lance home again. He\'s worth ten of you - and he married well. Lance is fearless and brave, even if he did risk a criminal prosecution once.\" Oh dear,\n\nI wish I hadn\'t said that!\'\n\n\'Don\'t worry,\' said Inspector Neele comfortingly. \'What\'s past is past. Tell me a little more about the staff here.\'\n\nInspector Neele was looking at the outside of Yewtree Lodge, a large, solid, red-brick building. The gardens were laid out in rose beds and ponds, with large numbers of neat yew hedges - and there was a huge yew tree, clearly very old. And possibly the poisonous berries from that very tree...? Inspector Neele rang the bell. The door was opened by a nervous-looking middle-aged man who invited Neele and Sergeant Hay in.\n\n\'Has Mrs Adele Fortescue returned yet?\'\n\n\'No, Sir.\'\n\n\'Nor Miss Elaine Fortescue?\'\n\n\'No, Sir.\'\n\n\'Then I would like to see Miss Dove, please.\'\n\nThe man turned his head slightly. \'Here\'s Miss Dove now - coming down the stairs.\'\n\nThe word housekeeper had given Neele an impression of someone large and powerful, dressed in black, and so the Inspector was quite unprepared for the small neat figure coming towards him. The light brown colour of her dress with its white collar and cuffs, the neat waves of hair and the slight smile, all seemed a little unreal, as though this young woman of under thirty was playing a part; not, Neele thought, the part of a housekeeper, but the part of Mary Dove, gentle and quiet like the bird, the dove, that shared her surname.\n\n\'Inspector Neele?\'\n\n\'Yes. This is Sergeant Hay. It seems likely that Mr Fortescue\'s death was caused by something he ate at breakfast this morning.\n\nI would like Sergeant Hay to be taken to the kitchen, where he can ask about the food that was served.\'\n\nHer eyes met his for a moment, thoughtfully, then she said, \'Of course.\' She turned to the butler, who was standing nervously nearby. \'Crump, will you take Sergeant Hay?\'\n\nThe two men left. Mary Dove said to Neele, \'Will you come in here?\' She opened the door of a sitting room and led him into it. \'Please sit down.\'\n\nMary Dove sat opposite him. She chose, he noticed, to face the light. An unusual choice for a woman. Still more unusual if a woman had anything to hide. But perhaps Mary Dove had nothing to hide.\n\n\'Mrs Adele Fortescue may return at any minute. And so may Mrs Jennifer. I have sent telegrams to Mr Percival Fortescue at various places.\'\n\n\'Thank you, Miss Dove.\'\n\n\'You say that Mr Fortescue\'s death was caused by something he may have eaten for breakfast? It seems unlikely. For breakfast this morning there was bacon and eggs, coffee, toast and marmalade. There was a cold ham, too, but that was also eaten yesterday, and no one was ill. No fish of any kind was served. For dinner last night...\'\n\n\'No.\' Inspector Neele interrupted her. \'We are not interested in dinner last night. Will you tell me exactly what Mr Fortescue ate and drank this morning?\'\n\n\'He had early tea brought to his room at eight o\'clock. Breakfast was at a quarter past nine. Mr Fortescue had eggs, bacon, coffee, toast and marmalade.\'\n\n\'Any cereal?\'\n\n\'No, he didn\'t like cereal.\'\n\n\'The sugar for the coffee...\'\n\n\'Mr Fortescue did not take sugar in his coffee,\' Miss Dove interrupted.\n\n\'Did he take any medicines in the morning?\'\n\n\'No, nothing like that.\'\n\n\'Who was at breakfast?\'\n\n\'Mrs Adele, Miss Elaine and Mrs Jennifer. Mrs Adele has only coffee, orange juice and toast, Mrs Jennifer and Miss Elaine always eat a large breakfast. As well as eating eggs and cold ham, they would probably have cereal as well. Mrs Jennifer drinks tea, not coffee.\'\n\nThree people had had breakfast with the deceased. Any of them might have had the opportunity to put taxine in Fortescue\'s cup of coffee. The bitterness of the coffee would have hidden the bitter taste of the Taxine... Neele looked up to find Mary Dove watching him.\n\n\'Your questions about medicines seem to me rather strange, Inspector,\' she said. \'It seems to suggest that either there was something wrong with a medicine, or that something had been put into it.\'\n\nNeele looked at her seriously. \'I did not say that Mr Fortescue died of food poisoning. But some kind of poisoning. In fact - just poisoning.\'\n\nShe repeated quietly, \'Poisoning...\' She appeared neither surprised nor anxious, simply interested. She said, \'I have never been involved with a poisoning case before.\'\n\n\'It\'s not very pleasant,\' Neele told her.\n\n\'No - I suppose not...\' She looked up at him with a sudden smile. \'I didn\'t do it,\' she said. \'But I suppose everybody says that!\'\n\n\'Have you any idea who did do it, Miss Dove?\'\n\nShe shrugged her shoulders. \'He was a horrible man. Anybody might have done it.\'\n\n\'Miss Dove, tell me something about the household here.\'\n\nShe looked up at him. He was a little surprised to see she looked amused.\n\n\'I don\'t want what I am going to say to be repeated at the inquest, but I would like to say it - unofficially.\'\n\n\'I\'m listening, Miss Dove.\'\n\nShe leaned back. \'Let me start by saying that I\'ve no feeling of loyalty to my employers. I work for them because it\'s a job that pays well and I insist that it pays well.\'\n\nNeele said, \'I was a little surprised to find you doing this type of job. With your obvious intelligence...\'\n\n\'I ought to be working in an office?\' interrupted Mary Dove. \'My dear Inspector Neele, some people will pay anything - anything - to avoid household worries. Firstly, finding and employing staff is very boring. Secondly, running the house properly requires abilities that most of the people I work for don\'t have.\'\n\n\'And what happens if your staff leave you unexpectedly? I\'ve heard of such things.\'\n\nMary smiled. \'If necessary, I can make the beds, clean the rooms, cook a meal and serve it, without anyone noticing the difference. But I work only for the extremely rich, who will pay anything to be comfortable. I pay top prices and so I get the best people available.\'\n\n\'Such as the butler?\' Neele asked, remembering the nervous Crump, whose red nose said he clearly liked alcohol too much.\n\nShe was amused. \'Crump stays because of Mrs Crump, who is one of the best cooks I\'ve ever worked with. As for Crump, he\'s not such a bad butler, really. I keep the key of the wine cellar and I watch the whisky and gin carefully. But you wanted to know what I think of the family. They are all really horrible. The late Mr Fortescue was the type of businessman who is always careful to work just on the right side of the law. He was rude and a bully. Mrs Fortescue, Adele - is about thirty years younger than he was - with real sex appeal, if you know what I mean.\'\n\nInspector Neele was shocked. A girl like Mary Dove ought not to say such things, he felt.\n\nThe young lady was continuing, Adele married him for his money, and Percival and Elaine are as nasty as they can be to her, but she doesn\'t care. Rex Fortescue would do anything for her. Oh dear, the wrong tense. I haven\'t really understood yet that he\'s dead...\'\n\n\'Let\'s hear about Percival Fortescue.\'\n\n\'Percival is a sly man. He\'s terrified of his father and has always let himself be bullied.\'\n\n\'And his wife?\'\n\n\'Jennifer is quiet and seems very stupid. But she was a hospital nurse before her marriage - she nursed Percival when he had pneumonia and then he married her. Rex Fortescue disliked poor Jennifer. She dislikes - disliked him a lot, I think. Her main interests are shopping and the cinema; her main complaint is that her husband, Percival, doesn\'t give her enough money.\'\n\n\'What about the daughter?\'\n\n\'Elaine? She\'s one of those schoolgirls who never grow up. There was some sort of romance with a young schoolmaster, Gerald Wright, but Mr Fortescue discovered the young man had communist ideas and made them end the relationship.\'\n\n\'She hadn\'t got the courage to stand up to him?\'\n\n\'She had. It was the young man who went away. I don\'t think he liked the idea that if she had married him, her father would have stopped giving her money to live on. Elaine is not particularly attractive.\'\n\n\'And the other son?\'\n\n\'I\'ve never seen Mr Lance. He\'s attractive, everyone says, but a bad boy. He forged a cheque in the past. He lives in East Africa. Mr Fortescue couldn\'t throw him out of the business completely because he\'d already made him a junior partner, but he hadn\'t kept in touch with him for years. All the same, I wouldn\'t be surprised if old Fortescue had been planning to get him back here. About a month ago, he discovered something that his eldest son, Percival, had been doing behind his back - I don\'t know what it was - and he was furious.\'\n\n\'Now, what about the servants? You\'ve described the Crumps. Who else is there?\'\n\n\'Gladys Martin is the parlour maid. She cleans the downstairs rooms, lays the table, clears away and helps Crump wait at table. Quite a respectable sort of girl, but very stupid. Ellen Curtis is elderly and bad-tempered, but an excellent housemaid.\'\n\n\'And those are the only people living here?\'\n\n\'There\'s old Miss Ramsbottom, Mr Fortescue\'s first wife\'s sister, who is well over seventy. She has a room on the second floor and never comes downstairs. She never liked her brother- in-law, but she came here while her sister was alive and stayed on when she died. Mr Fortescue isn\'t very interested in her. She\'s quite a character, though, is Miss Ramsbottom - or Aunt Effie as everyone calls her.\'\n\n\'So we come to you, Miss Dove.\'\n\n\'I\'m an orphan. I took a secretarial course and then a job as a shorthand typist. I decided I was in the wrong business, and started on my present career. I have been with three different employers. After about eighteen months I get tired of a place and move on. I have been at Yewtree Lodge for just over a year. I will type out the names and addresses of my previous employers and give them, with a copy of my references, to Sergeant Hay.\'\n\nNeele was silent for a moment, enjoying a mental image of Miss Dove collecting yew berries in a little basket. With a sigh he returned to the present. \'Now, I would like to see Gladys Martin and then Ellen Curtis.\' He added as he stood up, \'By the way, Miss Dove, can you give me any idea why Mr Fortescue would be carrying loose grain - rye, in fact - in his pocket?\'\n\n\'Grain?\' She stared at him.\n\n\'Yes - grain. Does that mean anything to you, Miss Dove?\'\n\n\'Nothing at all.\'\n\n\'Who looked after his clothes?\'\n\n\'Crump.\'\n\n\'I see. Did Mr Fortescue and Mrs Fortescue share the same bedroom?\'\n\n\'Yes. He had a dressing room and bathroom, of course, and so did she...\' Mary looked down at her wristwatch. \'I really think that she ought to be back very soon now.\'\n\nThe Inspector said in a pleasant voice, \'It seems to me very strange that even though there are three golf courses in the neighbourhood, it has not been possible to find Mrs Fortescue on one of them. Who was she playing with?\'\n\n\'I think it is possible that it might be Mr Vivian Dubois.\'\n\n\'I see.\'\n\n\'I\'ll send Gladys in to you. She\'ll probably be scared to death.\' Mary Dove went out. Inspector Neele looked at the closed door. What she had told him was very useful. If Rex Fortescue had been deliberately poisoned, and it seemed almost certain that he had, then there appeared to be plenty of motives at Yewtree Lodge.', 1, 1, 0, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie', 39156, 11701),
(39200, '\nA Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie\n\nPart 1\n\nMiss Somers, who was not the best typist in the office, poured the tea and took the cups round.\n\n Miss Griffith, the well-organized head typist who had been with Consolidated Investments Trust for sixteen years, tasted her tea and asked sharply. \'Are you sure the water was boiling when you put it on the tea leaves, Somers? If it isn\'t boiling, the tea tastes horrible!\n\n At that moment Miss Grosvenor, an incredibly glamorous blonde, who was Mr Fortescue\'s personal secretary, came in to make his tea herself. Then she went out again, carrying the tea tray in front of her.\n\n Mr Fortescue\'s office was a large room with a shining wood floor and behind a huge desk sat Mr Fortescue, a large, fat man with a bald head. Miss Grosvenor put the tray on the desk saying quietly, \'Your tea, Mr Fortescue,\' then left. Miss Grosvenor went back into her own office, made two telephone calls and looked at the clock. It was ten minutes past eleven. Just then a terrible cry came from Mr Fortescue\'s office. Miss Grosvenor rushed in and found her employer behind his desk, his body twisting in pain. He was finding it difficult to speak.\n\n \'Tea - what did you put in the tea - get a doctor...\'\n\n Miss Grosvenor went running into the typists\' office, shouting, \'Mr Fortescue - we must get a doctor - I\'m sure he\'s dying.\'\n\n But it had never been necessary to call a doctor to the office before now. Where was there a doctor nearby? Miss Griffith said, \'We can call his own doctor! Get the private address book.\' Then, just to be sure, she told the office boy to go out and find a doctor - anywhere.\n\n Miss Grosvenor said tearfully, \'There couldn\'t have been anything wrong with the tea.

Inspector Neele looked like an ordinary man, but his way of thinking was very imaginative.\n\n Miss Griffith had just left, after giving him an exact report of the morning\'s events.

The address was a respectable one and she probably lived there with her parents. Inspector Neele questioned her about how she had made Mr Fortescue\'s tea.

And now he was married to the widow of Lord Frederick Anstice, a man who had killed himself rather than face an inquiry about his racehorses.\n\n Neele picked up the phone and dialled and soon a man\'s voice said, \'Baydon Heath 3400.\'\n\n \'I want to speak to Mrs Adele Fortescue or Miss Elaine Fortescue.\'\n\n \'They aren\'t in, either of them.\'\n\n Are you the butler?\'\n\n \'That\'s right.\'\n\n \'Is there anyone in the house I can speak to about Mr Rex Fortescue\'s illness?\'\n\n \'Well, there\'s Miss Dove, the housekeeper.\'\n\n \'I\'ll speak to Miss Dove, please.\'\n\n A minute or two later a woman\'s voice spoke. \'This is Miss Dove.\' The voice was low and musical.\n\n \'I am sorry to have to tell you, Miss Dove, that Mr Rex Fortescue died a short time ago. I need to contact his relatives...\'\n\n \'Of course,\' she said, her voice calm. \'The person you really want to speak to is Mr Percival Fortescue. You might find him at the Midland Hotel in Manchester or possibly at the Grand in Leicester. Mrs Adele Fortescue will be home for dinner and she may be in to tea. It will be a great shock to her. Mr Fortescue was well when he left here this morning. What was it? His heart? \'\n\n \'Did he have heart trouble?\' Neele asked.\n\n \'No, but as it was so sudden...\' She broke off. \'Are you speaking from St Jude\'s Hospital?\'\n\n \'No, Miss Dove, I\'m speaking from Mr Fortescue\'s office. I am Detective Inspector Neele and I will be coming down to see you as soon as I can get there.\'\n\n \'Detective Inspector? Do you mean... what do you mean?\'\n\n \'Miss Dove, when there is a sudden death, we are called to the scene, especially when the deceased hadn\'t seen a doctor lately - he hadn\'t, had he?\'\n\n \'No. Mr Percival made an appointment twice for him, but he refused to go. He was quite unreasonable - they were all worried...\' She broke off and then continued as calmly as before. \'If Mrs Fortescue returns to the house before you arrive, what do you want me to tell her?\'\n\n What a practical and sensible woman she is, thought Inspector Neele. Aloud he said, \'Just tell her that in a case of sudden death we have to make a few inquiries. Routine inquiries.\'', 1, 1, 0, 'A Pocket Full of Rye by Agatha Christie', 39199, 11701),

You happen to be standing next to a switch that will divert the trolley onto a second track. Here\'s the problem. That track has a worker on it, too, but just one. What do you do? Do you  @sacrifice@  one person to save five? This is the trolley problem, a version of an ethical  @dilemma@  that philosopher Philippa Foot devised in 1967. It\'s popular because it forces us to think about how to choose when there are no good choices. Do we pick the action with the best outcome or stick to a moral code that prohibits causing someone\'s death? In one survey, about 90% of respondents said that it\'s okay to flip the switch, letting one worker die to save five, and other studies, including a virtual reality simulation of the dilemma , have found similar results. These  @judgments@  are consistent with the philosophical  @principle@  of utilitarianism which argues that the  @morally@  correct decision is the one that maximizes well-being for the greatest number of people. The five lives outweigh one, even if achieving that outcome requires  @condemning@  someone to death. But people don\'t always take the utilitarian view, which we can see by changing the trolley problem a bit. This time, you\'re standing on a bridge over the track as the runaway trolley approaches. Now there\'s no second track, but there is a very large man on the bridge next to you. If you push him over, his body will stop the trolley, saving the five workers, but he\'ll die. To utilitarians, the decision is exactly the same, lose one life to save five. But in this case, only about 10% of people say that it\'s OK to throw the man onto the tracks. Our instincts tell us that deliberately causing someone\'s death is different than allowing them to die as collateral damage. It just feels wrong for reasons that are hard to explain. This intersection between ethics and psychology is what\'s so interesting about the trolley problem. The dilemma in its many variations reveals that what we think is right or wrong depends on factors other than a logical weighing of the pros and cons. For example, men are more likely than women to say it\'s okay to push the man over the bridge. So are people who watch a comedy clip before doing the thought experiment.

They broke the bones in the leg, then they screwed metal spikes into the bone. It has not only spikes, but wires that go all the way through the leg to stabilize it. I have to walk on it. I have to stretch it out so that my muscles don\'t just get all atrophied. People always ask me, \"Does it hurt?\" Yes, it does, but I focus on what I can do, not on what I cannot do. I want to talk with you guys about  @overcoming@   @obstacles@ . Everybody has obstacles, a dis @ability@ , a  @hurdle@  . We face a choice: Let the obstacle overcome you or overcome the obstacle. Maybe some of you have heard of Jim Abbott. He was a Major League baseball player. He won a gold medal in the Olympics. He played for the Yankees, the Angels. But he threw a no-hitter, and he only had one arm. When he was a kid, he came home mad one time and told his dad, \"The kids won\'t let me play baseball because I only have one hand.\" His dad replied, \"No, the kids won\'t let you play baseball because you stink at baseball. You can\'t  @change@  the fact that you only have one hand, but you can change the fact that you stink.\" So, his dad began to practice with him, and he got good. He overcame obstacles . Teams would try to exploit his weak side. They would try to bunt to the side that he had a missing arm. But they never succeeded because he practiced and practiced fielding bunts to that side. There\'s no dishonor in having a disability, and I won\'t let anyone diss my ability , but I don\'t want anyone\'s pity either. I will not use the obstacles I face as an excuse for having a pity party. I will practice harder, play harder, and push myself harder to keep getting better. Last season I started on my varsity high school basketball team as a freshman, and I won Rookie of the Year. I was one of the top scorers on the team. One of the things that I find funny is that people judge me by appearance. They say, \"Oh, look at this one-handed whitey with the limp. I don\'t want him on my team!\" But what they don\'t know is that I don\'t just have a disability, I have an ability. One of my favorite moments from this last season was we played a team that we had never played before. And when the game started, you could tell that they were dissing my disability. I mean, they double-teamed our tallest player. They just were playing really soft on me, and they just, you could tell they thought, \"What can this guy with one hand do?\" So, they left me open for a three. I made that one. They left me open for another one. I made that one. Then, they started to get  @frustrated@  , so they actually fouled me. I made both free throws. And they called time out. And as we were in the huddle, I could hear the other coach yelling at his players about me. They went from not covering me at all to double-teaming me. It\'s all about overcoming obstacles.

And just think, robots don\'t need health  @benefits@  , vacation or even sleep for that matter. But the debate over whether robots will take over all of our jobs is by no means settled. Many economists argue automation will ultimately create new jobs. After all, someone has to program the robots, right?

And some companies say the same thing will happen when robots move into the marketplace.

It\'s hard to imagine that robots could replicate human characteristics, like empathy or compassion, that are required in many jobs.

I simply love learning languages.\" But people were never happy with that answer. They wanted to know why they are spending years trying to learn even one language, never achieving @fluency@ , and here I come, learning one language after another. They wanted to know the secret of polyglots, people who speak a lot of languages. And that made me wonder, too, how do actually other polyglots do it? What do we have in \n@common@ ? And what is it that enables us to learn languages so much faster than other people?\nI decided to meet other people like me and find that out. The best place to meet a lot of polyglots is an event where hundreds of language lovers meet in one place to \n@practice@ their languages. There are several such polyglot events organized all around the world, and so I decided to go there and ask polyglots about the methods that they use.\nAnd so I met Benny from Ireland, who told me that his method is to start speaking from day one. He learns a few phrases from a travel phrasebook and goes to meet \n@native speakers@ and starts having conversations with them right away. He doesn\'t mind making even 200 mistakes a day, because that\'s how he learns, based on the feedback. And the best thing is, he doesn\'t even need to travel a lot today, because you can easily have conversations with native speakers from the comfort of your living room, using websites.\nI also met Lucas from Brazil who had a really interesting method to learn Russian. He simply added a hundred random Russian speakers on Skype as \n@friends@ , and then he opened a chat window with one of them and wrote \"Hi\" in Russian. And the person replied, \"Hi, how are you?\" Lucas copied this and put it into a text window with another person, and the person replied, \"I\'m fine, thank you, and how are you?\" Lucas copied this back to the first person, and in this way, he had two strangers have a @conversation@ with each other without knowing about it. And soon he would start typing himself, because he had so many of these conversations that he figured out how the Russian conversation usually starts.\nWhat an ingenious method, right?\n', 1, 1, 0, 'The secrets of learning a new language', NULL, NULL, NULL, 35512, 10),

First, I made a list of the top 100 female Instagram stars, purely based on following. FYI, the number one spot currently goes to Ariana Grande at 164 million followers. Next is Selena Gomez at 156 million followers. And then Kim Kardashian at 147 million followers. Then I came up with 22 attributes that each woman could be judged on. These included things like @hair colour@, hair length, neck length, @face shape@, body shape, eye color, clothing size, flatness of stomach, lip size, eye size, nose size, skin color, chest size, prominence of butt, age, height, et cetera. I worked with a fellow researcher to get as accurate,an answer as possible per attribute. Things like height were straightforward and easy to find online, but other things like chest size and prominence of butt, were more @subjective@. So we had to do our best by analyzing the influencer\'s, latest pictures on Instagram. After a couple of weeks of gathering data and categorizing data, I can tell you that there is most definitely a formula and a very specific beauty standard that the top 100 most followed women on Instagram adhere to. It\'s fascinating, but also incredibly eerie in a time when you would think social media has even the playing field for women of all body types, sizes, ethnicities and @skin colour@. So are you ready to hear the results? Here\'s the beauty breakdown of your top 100, most followed females on Instagram. The most common age is 22 years old. The most common height is five foot seven.

Outwardly the scene is utterly  @unremarkable@  and could initially appear to be deeply unpromising material for a painting and yet, like any great artist, Købke has known how to interrogate his own perceptions in a fresh unclouded, underivative manner and translated them accurately into his medium, weaving a small masterpiece out of the thread of everyday life.

These somewhat strange feline  @behaviors@ , both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking, \"Why do cats do that?\" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously solitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended on crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild and domestic cats today. While the feline  @actions@  of your house cat Grizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats for millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure and keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points to survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn\'t need these particular skills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room from the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are  @opportunistic@  and hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat many times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat strategy to stay fed. This is why Grismo prefers to chase and pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course of the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny spaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo\'s propensity to reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by the same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of her species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces kept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and  @relieve@  some stress, too. So, it\'s not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else you put in her environment.

Together, they create a harmful stew called leachate, which can move into groundwater, soil and streams, poisoning ecosystems and harming  @wildlife@  . It can take bottle one an agonizing 1,000 years to decompose. Bottle two\'s journey is stranger but, unfortunately, no happier. He floats on a trickle that reaches a stream, a stream that flows into a river, and a river that reaches the ocean. After months lost at sea, he\'s slowly drawn into a massive vortex, where trash accumulates, a place known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Here the ocean\'s currents have trapped millions of pieces of plastic debris. This is one of five plastic-filled gyres in the world\'s seas. Places where the pollutants turn the water into a cloudy plastic soup. Some animals, like seabirds, get entangled in the mess. They, and others, mistake the brightly colored plastic bits for food.

The second question, equally as interesting, I think, is, Why do you know this? I mean, we\'re living in an age where everything can be googled. You probably all own some of those things here, fittingly named smartphones. So, all you have to do is type it in, and there\'s Wikipedia or Google answering for you. So, I do it too.

You have to develop genuine interest because that\'s the way you\'re going to focus and pay attention to. Without any attention, you won\'t remember anything. You can\'t fake that.

What I have though, I think, I\'m more interested. I\'ve got an appetite for all of that. And that\'s what you got to develop in order to form your general knowledge, in order to know more. There are basically four keys to develop that interest. The first one? It\'s emotion. We\'re not this rational being, right?

When we think about someone’s personality, for example, we’re usually evaluating them on a scale of certain aspects: humor, compassion, outgoingness — but what about  @adventurousness@  ? What is it about our biology, that makes some of us  @risk takers@  — and some of us not? It turns out, like most things in  @life@  — the answer isn’t black or white. It’s more like, a rainbow of colors that are constantly changing, for each new phase of life we enter. In reality, everyone has different reasons for why they choose to take risks — so people who are cautious in some areas, may actually embrace taking risks in others. Elke Weber is a psychologist and business professor at Columbia University, who developed the \"domain-specific risk propensity\" model. It theorizes that everyone has a unique risk propensity, spread out among five categories: financial, health/  @safety@  , recreational, ethical, and social. And your willingness to take risks, she says, can vary widely from one category to the next. It’s the gender divide, though, that really explains the underlying reason for risk-taking. Obviously there are exceptions, but generally speaking, men tend to take more risks than women — and especially financial and recreational risks. It harkens back to a “culture of honor,” where men feel like they need to defend themselves and assert their masculinity, in order to protect their honor. And taking risks is one way to do that. But according to Andreas Wilke, an expert on risk-taking and decision-making, there’s also a sexual aspect to it. Because men have more intra-sexual  @competition@  than women do for sex, they feel the need to advertise their sexual fitness through daring exploits. So “if you compare the behavior of a single adolescent male,” he says, “with his behavior when women are watching, you can see how the risk increases.” Sure enough, people — and especially men — tend to become less risk-seeking as they get older, and as they enter into stable relationships. But that’s not to say that women aren’t risk-takers either. In fact, studies have consistently shown that women tend to take more social risks than men. Things like moving to a new city, wearing unconventional clothes, changing careers later in life, or expressing unpopular opinions during a business meeting. What’s especially interesting, is other research showing that experiencing discrimination or rejection leads people to take more chances. So if women feel as though they’re operating under a patriarchal society, it makes sense that they might take even more social risks, as a way of tacitly  @fighting@  back.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 28186, 10),

That may not sound like much, but it adds up to millions of dollars in cold hard cash.  @counterfeit@   @money@  has the potential to cause all sorts of problems, from leaving you short $20 to destabilizing national economies. But don\'t worry. You can help catch the counterfeits. All you need are some simple tools and a bit of chemistry. First up, the anti-counterfeit detection pen. The pen looks like a highlighter and contains a solution of potassium iodide and elemental iodine. It reveals the presence of starch, which is commonly used to strengthen regular printer paper, but won\'t be found in real money . That\'s because authentic bills are made of cotton and linen and are threaded with tiny red and blue fibers. That material is made by a single, highly-guarded company called Crane and Company, which has been printing  @currency@  since Paul Revere asked them to help finance the Revolutionary War. The starch in many counterfeit bills, on the other hand, is made of two molecules: amylopectin and amylose. It\'s amylose that gives the fake away. Its long chain of sugar molecules connected by oxygen atoms forms a helical structure, like DNA. Iodide likes to squeeze inside this coil, forming a new compound that leaves a dark mark on the paper. However, in the absence of starch, there is no chemical reaction and the mark will look light yellow. So if the fake isn\'t printed on starchy paper, iodine solutions can\'t help you. That\'s one of the reasons U.S. bills printed since 1996 have been chemically enhanced to include another counterfeit countermeasure: a strip that fluoresces under UV light. That\'s the same kind of light used at black light parties and airport security lines. The polyester strip printed with invisible ink is just one millimeter wide and is found in different positions depending on a bill\'s  @value@  . If you hold your dollar up to natural light, you can see the amount and the word USA printed on the band. But under UV light, these strips will really shine. They contain molecules that can be excited by absorbing certain amounts of energy, specifically, that given off by common UV light sources. As these excited molecules return to their original states, they lose a bit of energy as heat and then radiate the rest as light. Energy is inversely related to wavelength, which means that the longer wavelengths have lower energy. So the lower energy light given off by the strip means longer wavelengths that fall in the visible range, and suddenly we can see that which had been invisible.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 28192, 10),

Though some parts may be based on real events, the encounters with strange monsters, terrifying giants and powerful magicians are considered to be complete  @fiction@  . But might there be more to these myths than meets the eye? Let\'s look at one famous episode from the poem. In the midst of their long voyage, Odysseus and his crew find themselves on the mysterious island of Aeaea. Starving and exhausted, some of the men stumble upon a palatial home where a stunning woman welcomes them inside for a sumptuous feast. Of course, this all turns out to be too good to be true. The woman, in fact, is the nefarious sorceress Circe, and as soon as the soldiers have eaten their fill at her table, she turns them all into animals with a wave of her wand. Fortunately, one of the men escapes, finds Odysseus and  @tells@  him of the crew\'s plight. But as Odysseus rushes to save his men, he meets the messenger god, Hermes, who advises him to first consume a magical herb. Odysseus follows this advice, and when he finally encounters Circe, her  @spells@  have no effect on him, allowing him to defeat her and rescue his crew. Naturally, this story of witchcraft and animal transformations was dismissed as nothing more than imagination for centuries. But in recent years, the many mentions of herbs and drugs throughout the passage have piqued the interest of scientists, leading some to suggest the @myths@ might have been fictional expressions of real experiences. The earliest versions of Homer\'s text say that Circe mixed baneful drugs into the food such that the crew might utterly forget their native land. As it happens, one of the plants growing in the Mediterranean region is an innocent sounding herb known as Jimson weed, whose effects include pronounced amnesia. The plant is also loaded with compounds that disrupt the vital neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Such disruption can cause vivid hallucinations, bizarre behaviors, and general difficulty distinguishing  @fantasy@  from reality, just the sorts of things which might make people believe they\'ve been turned into animals, which also suggests that Circe was no sorceress, but in fact a chemist who knew how to use local plants to great effect. But Jimson weed is only half the story. Unlike a lot of material in the Odyssey, the text about the herb that Hermes gives to Odysseus is unusually specific. Called moly by the gods, it\'s described as being found in a forest glen, black at the root and with a flower as @white as milk@. .Like the rest of the Circe episode, moly was dismissed as fictional invention for centuries.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 28248, 10),

That competitor just experienced the phenomenon known as \"choking,\" where despite months, even years, of practice, a person  @fails@  right when it matters most. Choking is common in sports, where performance often occurs under intense pressure and depends on key moments. And yet, performance anxiety also haunts public speakers, contestants in spelling bees, and even world-famous musicians. Most people intuitively blame it on their nerves, but why does being nervous undermine expert performance? There are two sets of theories, which both say that primarily, choking under pressure boils down to focus. First, there are the distraction theories. These suggest that performance suffers when the mind is  @preoccupied@  with worries, doubts, or fears, instead of focusing its attention on performing the task at hand. When relevant and irrelevant thoughts compete for the same attention, something has to give. The brain can only process so much information at once. Tasks that challenge working memory, the mental \"scratch pad\" we use to temporarily store phone numbers and grocery lists, are especially vulnerable to @pressure@ . In a 2004 study, a group of university students were asked to perform math problems, some easy, others more complex and memory-intensive. Half the students completed both problem types with nothing  @at stake@  , while the others completed them when calm and under pressure. While everyone did well on the easy problems, those who were stressed performed worse on the more difficult, memory-intensive tasks. Explicit monitoring theories make up the second group of explanations for choking under pressure. They\'re concerned with how pressure can cause people to overanalyze the task at hand. Here, the logic goes that once a skill becomes automatic, thinking about its precise mechanics interferes with your ability to do it. Tasks we do unconsciously seem to be most vulnerable to this kind of choking. A study on competitive golfers compared their performance when instructed to simply focus on putting as accurately as possible, versus when they were primed to be acutely aware of the mechanics of their putting stroke. Golfers usually perform this action subconsciously, so those who suddenly tuned in to the precise details of their own moves also became worse at making accurate shots. Choking may not be inevitable for everyone though.

It\'s a lot easier than it sounds. If you tend to over-analyse, try making a few decisions based on your gut instinct. You will be surprised at the way people respect your positive actions. Remember, the more you practise being assertive and proactive, the more it becomes second nature.

It will help to boost your confidence.\" Karen Pickering, Swimming World Champion, 1993 \"Be organised and disciplined. Every week I do 10 two-hour sessions in the pool and three two-hour gym sessions. There is no way I could get through that sort of workload without being on top of my diary. I have learned that this is also the key to success in other aspects of life. You can\'t pursue a career in any discipline without being organised. Make lists of what you want to do and what you want to achieve and then plan your progress towards your goal. Just by writing down your goals for the day, however small they are, you\'ll be a step closer to achieving them.\" Kirsten Best, Poet & Novelist \"Concentrate. Sometimes a voice inside your head tells you that you can\'t do something. Then there are external distractions, such as family or lifestyle. The key is to make sure that these don\'t have a detrimental effect. Concentration will make you feel more in control of your life and it will boost your confidence and self-belief. Occasionally, I use key words that help me stay focused. When I\'m stressed, for example, it helps to repeat words such as \"calm\", \"peace\" or \"focus\", either out loud or silently in my mind. This is a habit that can become second nature quite easily and is a powerful psychological tool.\" Roger Black, Olympic 400 metres Silver Medalist \"I used imagery and visualisation a lot when I was competing and I\'m convinced it helped a great deal in my success. Imagine you are experiencing success. Mentally transfer yourself to the place where you can see, hear and smell what is going on around you. Then run through the possible permutations of what could happen. This way you will be prepared for everything and afraid of nothing. One example of this being put to its best use is when you are asked to give a presentation at work.

Whatever it was, that particular fact or figure has buried itself deep within the  @vault@  of your memory and you just can\'t seem to  @retrieve@  it. My advice, is don\'t put up with having an average memory. Improving your memory is a skill. If you master some basic techniques, remembering facts and figures can become a stimulating mental exercise - not to mention a chance to show off in conversation! Plus, a good memory for facts and figures can help you to  @sail through@  exams. People think that because I can remember so many facts and figures I must have a photographic memory. This isn\'t the case. There was a time when I struggled to remember seven or eight  @digits@  in a row, let alone 20 or 30 - and now I\'m the eight-times winner of the World Memory. Championships. I didn\'t just wake up one morning with the ability to remember. I simply studied the techniques for making my mind more  @supple@  and put them into practice. Here, I reveal these methods, sharing with you my specially devised exercises that will help you never forget facts and figures. Drugs to boost brain power will become \'as common as coffee\' Power stimulants that improve memory, intellectual agility or other aspects of mental performance will almost certainly be developed over the next 20 years. They will have few side-effects, little or no addictive properties and could be used for boosting exam performance, making better business decisions or even eliminating bad memories. \'In a world that is increasingly non-stop and competitive, the individual\'s use of such substances may move from the fringe to the norm, with cognition enhancers used as coffee is today, \'says the Foresight report of the government\'s Office of Science and Technology. \'Cognition enhancers are likely to be developed to treat people who need to improve attention, memory or wakefulness and to help people forget, sleep more efficiently and be less impulsive.\' Drugs that help people to forget disturbing experiences raises the prospect of a future portrayed in films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, where characters are able to forget painful relationships. But the possibility raises disturbing practical, ethical and social issues. \'It is possible that such an advance could usher in a new era of drug use without addiction\', says the report. \'If we ever find ourselves in a society that embraced cognition enhancers, \"mental cosmetics\" could become accepted and raise expectations about the performance and behavior of individuals and groups.\' Food for thought Increasingly, it is recognized that diet plays a vital role in exam performance. According to senior nutrition consultant Lorraine Perretta, the brain needs fuel just like any other organ. \'Without the correct diet, it cannot give its peak performance,\' she says. \'Eating the right foods can dramatically improve learning, concentration and memory.\' Patrick Holford, author of Optimum Nutrition for the Mind, points out that the brain uses a quarter of all the carbohydrates you eat under normal conditions, rising to around 40 per cent at times of intense concentration. \'During an exam, your legs don\'t need the energy as you are sitting down. Your brain uses it all and that\'s why you are starving at the end of an exam. You would train your body for a physical exam, so why not do the same for a mental test?\' In order for the brain cells to communicate effectively with each other they need neurotransmitters, the messengers that carry information. Acetylcholine (ACh) is the neurotransmitter responsible for memory, and studies have found that people with Alzheimer\'s may have less of it. Foods rich in the vitamin complex needed to make ACh include egg yolks, peanuts, liver, broccoli, fish and cheese. Drinking water is also important. The brain is 70 per cent water, and when it is dehydrated it works more slowly. This is particularly true of memory; a dehydrated brain releases the stress hormone cortisol, which adversely affects the brain\'s ability to store information. Too much coffee will also slow down the thinking process and make you feel foggy.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 33863, 10),

Tony Perrottet loses himself in Tasmania. \"If this isn\'t lonely enough for you,\" a grizzled Tasmanian sheep farmer told me, pointing out towards some desolate and windswept alpine scrub, \"try the Twisted Lakes. You can have as much solitude as you want round there,\" he chortled. I wasn\'t sure if this was a recommendation or a warning. In Australia\'s enormous island state, solitary bushwalkers still occasionally disappear never to be seen again. The farmer was talking about Cradle Mountain-Lake, St Clair National Park, more than 1,200 square km of mountain wilderness on the rim of Tasmania\'s  @savage@  central highlands. I resolved to go. A few days later, when I made it to Cradle Mountain, I could see what the farmer meant. Tasmania was at its most  @benign@  - brilliantly sunny, which apparently occurs here only one day in every 10. I\'d left the main walking trail just a few hundred yards behind, and there I was, the only living soul in a  @pristine@  moorland, gazing into a  @startling@  emptiness. I could taste the isolation in the air. The Tasmanian wind, having drifted thousands of miles across the Indian Ocean, is the purest on the planet. Alpine lakes glittered like dark pearls in the sun. Mountain ridges continued into the horizon, row after row, ad infinitum. I stopped at a  @rivulet@  to take a drink - safe as Evian - then stripped off my clothes and threw myself naked into a chilly lake. Nobody was going to disturb me here in my own private valley... not today, not tomorrow, maybe not even for another month. There are few places on the earth where you can keep your own company so easily as Tasmania - although when I first arrived in Cradle Mountain, I didn\'t actually feel that alone. I\'d spent the night before at a chalet-style lodge with a gaggle of  @raucous@  Aussies on summer holidays, while Eagles songs played over and over on a perpetual loop. When I woke up the next morning, the countryside was swathed in a chilly, pea-soup mist. But by the time I\'d finished breakfast, the sky had transformed into a dome of cloudless blue - an invitation to explore. A park ranger, identifiable by a badge with a pink Tasmanian devil on it, pointed out the route to the Twisted Lakes: \"Just chuck a left at Hanson\'s Peak, mate. Not a soul up there.\" \'Chucking a left\' took me over a mountain ridge and into the void. Up above, bare granite peaks protruded like decaying teeth. Clusters of tiny scarlet flowers swayed in the bush. At one turn, I nearly tripped over a wombat. This shy, muscular, almost spherical creature scratched itself awake and lumbered off like a miniature tank, smashing branches as it went. As the sun climbed, bathing the landscape in a dreamy warmth, the trail wound upwards onto a highland plateau. That\'s when I found the Twisted Lakes - a trio of moss-fringed tarns looking as deliberately arranged as a Japanese garden. As I took my skinny dip, I realised why Tasmania is considered a hiker\'s paradise by Australians. In the rest of the country you often have to travel for days to notice a change in landscape. It\'s far from virgin, however. Walkers on the trail past Hanson\'s Peak have engraved a relatively clean path on the bushy terrain. I was tempted to use it myself, but only for a moment. The temptation of attempting to reach the Peak itself was too powerful. It would take some serious climbing, but the sun was still high, and the potential reward for bothering to unpack my climbing gear far too great to ignore. It was early afternoon when the trail emerged on the flanks of Little Horn, the lower peak of Cradle Mountain. I had the choice of turning back or continuing in a wide loop around Dove Lake, which sparkled like black opal far below. Well, I thought cockily, how hard could it get? But then the landscape changed again. The soil became drier, the sun brighter, the heat blistering. My water was running low. The trek was starting to feel like an out-take from Beau Geste. And was I even going the right way? Finally, I recognised the path - heading down, down, straight down a blunt outcrop of stone called Bald Rock. I vaguely remembered the park ranger warning me about this. (\"She\'s a tricky one,\" he\'d smirked. \"Take her slow.\") From up above, the rock looked like a giant, slippery slide. To my relief, a team of four Aussie bushwalkers suddenly appeared on the trail and joined me in contemplation of the view. It was easy to identify the couple from Tasmania - they were the ones who, even on this hot and cloudless summer\'s day, carried full rain gear and thermal underwear in their packs. \"We did this exact same hike last year,\" the boyfriend confided merrily. \"Started out perfect, just like today. By noon it was snowing.\" At this, the pair of them bounded down the rock face like mountain goats. \"Don\'t worry, you dingos,\" the girlfriend shouted back, \"it\'s not as bad as it looks.\" Of course, they were right. If you took it slowly, Bald Rock was a piece of cake. And at the bottom lay my reward, a lake of Olympic-pool proportions just begging for the ultimate mountain swim. Two hours later, having crossed a temperate rainforest whose giant ferns looked like something from Journey to the Centre of the Earth, I stumbled back to my car. It was nearly dark, and most visitors had left. But lounging beside his Land Cruiser was my old mate the park ranger, just making sure that the strugglers returned safely from the wilderness. \"Survive that lot, cobber?\" he asked cheerily. \"No worries, mate,\" I said, getting into the Tassie rhythm. \"If that\'s not lonely enough for you,\" he said, \"try the southwestern forests...\" I cut him off as fast as I could: \"No, no, that was plenty lonely enough\" - and roared back to the busy alpine lodge for a little raucous banter by the fireside and a few Eagles songs.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 33869, 10),

(33896, 'Psychotherapist Gael Lindenfield examines the role of grandparents today. No one warned me that in my early 40s, I would start  @cooing@  longingly into prams. I was totally unprepared to meet this new aspect of myself. My own nest had just emptied and I was eagerly filling the \'vacuum\' with  @innumerable@  career and globe-trotting adventures.  @Admittedly@  the master vision for the rest of my life did include a few happy granny and grandpa scenes, but they were more distant and more a family joke than a serious prediction. So this strange primitive urge to extend my family into another generation was both  @perplexing@  and even a little irritating. When the right time came, I had, of course, every intention of becoming a  @conscientious@  , involved grandparent. But that was more about doing the right thing for the children than fulfilling a deep instinctive need of my own. As a psychotherapist, I am hyper-aware of how life-transforming a good relationship with a grandparent can be. It offers so much more than treats, extra quality time and cheap nannying. Good grandparents help build psychological security by making their grandchildren feel part of a much wider, diverse and stable supportive family network. They also give them a sense of their place in history and evolution and give their life a meaningful sense of perspective. Even when we reach adulthood, our psychological health can be affected by the relationship that we may or may not have had with our grandparents. I frequently work with people who have (to put it mildly!) a less than perfect relationship with their own parents. Many times I have been able to help people heal emotionally by simply reawakening a  @cherished@  memory of a much happier and more unconditionally loving relationship with a grandparent. Alan was, in his own words, \'a hopeless case of workaholism\'. He still felt driven by trying to please his ambitious, perfectionist father. But, fortunately, I discovered that he had also received a much more unconditional kind of love from his calmer, happier and affectionate grandfather. Putting a photo of his grandad on his desk helped Alan keep his promise to himself to maintain better balance in his life. Similarly, another client, Angela, had very low self-esteem. We found that by just recalling her grandmother\'s look of pure joy when she used to greet her after school each day, Angela could give herself a powerful boost of confidence whenever she needed it. Until I became a grandparent myself, however, I never appreciated how important Alan and Angela must have been for the happiness and welfare of their grandparents. Nowadays, the chances of children and grandparents having such intimate, mutually satisfying relationships are fast diminishing. Recent research revealed that in Britain, one out of twenty grandparents is likely to have had no contact whatsoever with at least one of their grandchildren during the past five years. There are many new reasons for this distancing of generations. Sometimes, it\'s mere geography that keeps them apart. I recently met a woman who proudly showed me a picture of her family in Australia. Unfortunately, she told me, she had never visited them, and hadn\'t even seen her five-year-old granddaughter. Her son had brought over his seven-year-old son six years ago, but he hadn\'t had the time or money to visit since. She explained that she herself had a heart condition, which would make a long flight too risky. The positive aspect of this story was that, however sad this situation was for both parties, there appeared to be no bitterness or resentment. But many grandparents feel quite differently. They\'re being forced apart from their grandchildren by less acceptable factors of modern society. Perhaps pressure of time maintains the distance. After all, nowadays, even if close extended families live within easy visiting distance, they may still not see much of each other. Parents often spend so much of their precious weekends cleaning, shopping and decorating that they hardly have time to get to know their children. Equally, the children themselves may have such a heavy weekend of programmed activity that their time is also stretched to its limits. A visit to or from grandparents feels like a luxury that no one can afford. Another increasingly common reason for estrangement is the break-up of family through divorce or separation. Many grandparents who consequently lose contact with their grandchildren go through a painful bereavement process, which can even lead to emotional and physical illness. This is because they never give up hope. They will not accept the finality of separation or loss. It seems that the grandparenting instinct and bond is so strong that it is rarely killed by even the most bitter family squabbles and separations.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 33895, 10),

(33928, 'Seeing red can quite literally make you \"see red\". It can also make you eat faster. Colour influences the mind in mysterious ways, and those who wish to influence you - to make you buy their products, or work harder - often do so with color. But you can make this process work to your advantage. Go through the spectrum with Paul Kerton and Deirdre McQuillan; then use our color test to show you the finer shades of your personality and your temperament. The marketing world is full of folklore about consumer reactions to color: how, for example, too much green on a confectionery wrapper is a recipe for disaster. For years the food industry insisted that without its handy \"azo-\" dyes the public would find processed produce unappetising. Yet color preference can often sound like a mix of  @fad@  and cultural custom, especially when the French will eat grey tinned peas and beans, while the British will not, and we prefer green apples to the Americans\' glossy red. However, there is more to color than meets the eye. This, at least, is the view of light researcher John Ott, who has discovered that color may directly affect our nervous systems. The idea that color can affect the nervous system in some way seems strengthened by the fact that experiments have recorded raised blood pressure in red surroundings and lowered blood pressure in blue surroundings. Red evokes subjective reactions of increased energy and hunger; blue evokes tranquillity and relaxation. Whether knowingly or otherwise, the effects of seeing red have been cleverly exploited by fast food chains. As well as making people hungry, red and its close relation, orange, cause time to seem to pass more quickly and influence people to feel in a hurry. By using these colors, places like McDonald\'s create an atmosphere which increases the appetite but subtly  @dissuades@  the customer from hanging around for very long. Colour has also been used to striking effect in the marketing of consumer products. A group of housewives was once asked to test samples of identical soup powder in three different boxes, one yellow, one blue and one a mix of blue and yellow. Extraordinary results ensued: the powder in the yellow packet was judged to be so powerful that some said it had damaged their clothes, while the blue was said to be so weak that it left stains behind: the powder in the mix of blue and yellow was assessed as just right. Yet the only difference was in the color of the packet. Test your personality This is a shorter version of the full Lüscher Colour Test, developed over twenty years by Max Lüscher. The colors used were selected for their associations with physical and mental states. To find out what color says about your personality, briefly study the colors above and then choose the color which appeals to you most immediately. (Don\'t choose on the grounds of fashion or whether it does wonders for your hair.) Place them in order of preference. Red Red represents passion and energy. Red in the first position means you are impulsive, sexy and have a will to win. You are a good leader. You want to expand your horizons and live life to the full. Red in the seventh or eighth position means your desire for life and thirst for adventure have become less. Yellow Yellow represents happiness and relaxation. Anyone who chooses yellow in second, third or fourth place is a positive, optimistic person who always looks to the future - never backwards. You find life easy, and problems simply do not exist for you. Free from worry, you lead a carefree life; but this does not mean that you are lazy. You can be extremely hard-working, although not consistently. Yellow in first place means that you are ambitious and eager to please. When yellow is in the latter part of the spectrum you have had your hopes and dreams dashed and you feel isolated and disappointed, often becoming defensive and  @withdrawn@  . Green Green represents firmness and resistance to change. In first place, you are persistent, possessive and quite selfish. You are a high-achiever and an accumulator of \'things\' - like a penthouse, a BMW, a Rolex, a holiday flat, a compact disc-player. You want to be recognised and need to impress but worry about the prospect of failure. If green is a later choice, your ego has been bruised and you have been humbled by the resistance to your progress. Consequently you can be highly critical, sarcastic and stubborn. Violet A mixture of red and blue, violet represents a conflict between  @impulsiveness@  and calm sensitivity, dominance and submissiveness. The person who prefers violet wants to find a mystical, magical relationship. Both mentally and physically immature, you are stuck in a dream world of wishful thinking and fantasy. Often violet is chosen by adolescents who still see the world through fairy-tale eyes. When violet appears in the latter part of the sequence, it indicates that the person choosing it is more mature and has outgrown the \'fantasy\' vision of life, confronting harsh reality head-on. Brown Brown is the color of physical well-being and is an indicator of how healthy you think you are. If you put brown in fourth or fifth place you are not very concerned about your health and body. This means that you are probably in good shape. Those worried about illness tend to put brown earlier in their sequence. If you choose brown as your favorite color, you are restless and  @insecure@  . If brown is in eighth place, you don\'t care enough for your body: you may not be as healthy as you think. Placing brown early also indicates the importance of a secure environment: refugees often pick brown first. Grey Grey is a neutral and represents a point between two contrasting and conflicting motivations. Grey in the first position means that you want to shut yourself off from everything and remain  @uncommitted@  , so that you can swing with opinion and emotions. You hate joining anything with \'group\' connotations and are an observer rather than a doer. Those who choose grey in the eighth position seek to join in with everything, eager and enthusiastic. Such people will try absolutely everything in their efforts to achieve their goals. Blue Blue represents calmness and loyalty. A person who favours blue is sensitive and easily hurt. You never panic and are in total control of your life and content with the way it is going. You desire to lead an uncomplicated and worry-free life and are prepared to sacrifice certain goals in order to achieve this. You need a stable relationship without conflict. Perhaps, as a side-effect of contentment, you tend to put on weight. The later blue appears in the sequence, the more unsatisfied you are and the more you feel the need to break from the ties that restrict you. But you probably aren\'t unfeeling enough to walk out on a family or job; instead, you will suffer in silence. Black Black is the negation of color and means \'No\'. Anyone who chooses it in the first position (which is rare) is in revolt against their fate. Chosen second, it means you are prepared to give up everything else to achieve what you want. It is normally put in seventh or eighth place, representing control of one\'s destiny and a balanced outlook. If yellow precedes black in the first two positions, then a change is on the way.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 33927, 10),

(33934, 'We force children into reading far too early. Today Einstein, who learnt to read at 10, would be in  @remedial@  class, argues Anne Karpf. A good news story about education? It sounds like an oxymoron, but blazoned on Monday\'s front pages was the finding of a major new international survey that \"UK pupils move close to top of world class,\" especially in reading. This will have been gratifying to a government for whom \'education, education, education\' increasingly seems to be a euphemism for \'reading, reading, reading\'. But such singlemindedness has had other, unacknowledged consequences. The obsession with reading has led to a major decline in the time and energy given over to music, art and drama. And the  @heresy@  that dare not speak its name is that children are being pressurised to learn to read too early. Traditionalists, however, maintain that you\'re never too young to learn to read: on the contrary, the earlier the better. Reading, and especially early reading, is considered so  @self-evidently@  good that children are  @coaxed@  , pressed and, if required, bribed into submission. Being against it, is like being against vitamins or bank holidays - completely  @perverse@  . Among the over half-million web pages devoted to teaching children to read, none of those I browsed are on learning to read too soon. My own position has changed radically between my first and second children. The first taught herself to read at the age of four. Thereafter she secreted books around her bed like contraband, and had to be physically prised from them at the dinner table. When her younger sister started school last year, I expected a repeat performance. Like other reception class mothers, I peeked at her friends\' bookbags to see if the books they were reading were more advanced. Invariably they were. My growing anxiety was  @assuaged@  by a wise fellow mother remarking that my exuberant child was busily engaged in things, like pretend games and drawing, which delighted her more. She also loves books, but often pleads for the right to be able to make up her own stories to the pictures (frequently more exciting than those by the author). Should I be vacuuming away her words, and pumping in someone else\'s? Should I have been coercing her to try to read when she was plainly unwilling? I can coerce when it\'s necessary, but the thought of becoming a dictator in the matter of when she learned to read seemed so awful that I decided to stop meddling altogether. For the best part of a year I lugged her wretched bookbag to and from school without opening it, and resolved as far as possible to follow her own reading timetable. Her reception teacher adopted what today is a rare, daring stance: there isn\'t much you can do to make a child read before they\'re ready. But in other schools there\'s no shortage of horror stories, like the parents of four-year-olds paying for coaching to help them keep up with the fast readers. The mother of a four-and-a-half-year-old was told that her son had to apply himself to reading because the school didn\'t want him to end up at the bottom of the pile. Einstein may have learned to read only at 10, but today he\'d be stigmatised and in remedial class. Imagine the blow that might have dealt to his creative genius. Also, one problem with exerting such pressure on pre-school children is that it can make children resistant to reading. Once affecting extravagant interest in my second daughter\'s new book-title, I was rewarded with: \"You\'re just trying to get me to read it and I won\'t.\" Other parents are more successful in their efforts, yet all children get there in the end. What counts, surely, is how they do so, since this is paramount for future pleasure. You can, just about, drill children into learning to read, but you can\'t compel them to enjoy it. In a culture increasingly obsessed with what is measurable, what a pity reading pleasure can\'t be tested. Those who consider such reservations a middle-class luxury should look at Europe. We\'re alone in bullying children to read so young. The Norwegians don\'t start until they\'re seven, when it\'s usually painless. Sylvia Hopland, headteacher of the Norwegian School in London, says: \"We know that we could teach children to read at four, but we want them to spend those years playing. We want to teach them to solve problems, cooperate with others and cope with life.\" I think my own now almost-six-year-old would have preferred this approach. However, something has recently clicked in the reading part of her brain, and she is on the way to becoming a voracious reader.

(33966, 'The Swedish furniture company Ikea has made its founder, Ingvar Kamprad, one of the world\'s wealthiest people, with a fortune estimated at $18,5 bn. But instead of a chauffeur-driven limo, he drives a 10-year-old Volvo and whenever he flies, even long haul, it\'s in economy. Rather than travelling by taxi, he\'s even been known to use Stockholm\'s subway and public buses to take advantage of his pensioner\'s discount. And forget holidays in St.Tropez. Kamprad\'s idea of a break is fishing and rowing in his native Sweden. He once said that his idea of luxury is buying the occasional nice shirt. Kamprad\'s sole extravagance is having a small vineyard in Provence, which he describes, with characteristic  @dourness@  , as a \'very expensive hobby\'. His  @frugality@  is not born of a desire simply to build up his billions, but also to offer a guiding example to Ikea\'s 76,000 staff. His  @penny-pinching@  permeates Ikea. Even senior executives travel around Europe on budget airlines and always stay, they insist, in cut-price hotels. He  @reasons@  that if Ikea is to provide customers with low prices, its brutal control of costs has to extend to every level in the company. Born in Southern Sweden, Kamprad grew up on a village farm. In his teens, he discovered an  @aptitude@  for business and began importing and selling anything he thought he could make a profit on. He traded in cigarette lighters, Christmas cards and pens, and at the age of seventeen, Kamprad set up his company, Ikea, which took its name from his initials and the first letters of his family farm Elmtaryd and nearby village Agunnaryd. Having a company enabled Kamprad to bid for a contract to supply pencils and he was soon sending goods out with the daily milk round. He discovered that by buying goods  @in bulk@  he could sell them to his customers at low prices and still make a profit. Kamprad then acquired a disused factory and began turning out furniture. His low prices undercut Swedish cartels and in 1952 he opened a showroom in the town of Almhult to reassure people who felt his prices were simply too good to be true. Kamprad tinkered with furniture designs to keep costs low, but his big breakthrough came in 1955 with the birth of a product which would become a market leader. While trying to pack and ship a bulky table, Gillis Lundgren, an early employee and later the chief designer, hit upon the idea of taking the legs off and mailing them packed flat under the tabletop. Enter the flatpack. The secret of Ikea\'s products is functionality. The flatpack eliminated the cost of shipping vast quantities of air whenever a product was sent from factory to shopfloor. It also offloaded on to customers an expensive part of selling furniture - actually putting the stuff together. Flatpacks allowed furniture to be made so cheaply that, instead of accumulating emotional weight as it was passed down the generations, it would come to seem transient and disposable. This started a revolution in interior furnishing and now more than 300 million people worldwide frequent Ikea each year even though it has only about 200 branches. Employees have described Ikea as a \'cult\'. The company structure is less hierarchical than similar businesses - titles and privileges are taboo - and every year Kamprad personally hands out Christmas presents to each of Ikea\'s 2,500 staff members at its Almhult headquarters. The company never releases profit figures but sources suggest they are massive - around 18 per cent - while rival firms operate on single-figure margins. Kamprad long gave up the day-to-day running of Ikea and lives with his second wife in Switzerland, apparently for tax purposes. He has also sheltered his company from Sweden\'s taxes and death duties by creating trusts and holding companies, ensuring that Ikea will continue after he is gone.

A Tuesday morning in south London. Out past Sainsbury\'s and up some steps, there\'s a squat brick building that looks as though it means business. Half a dozen young men are lingering by the door. With their trainers, sweatshirts, track-suit bottoms and gleaming heads, they might have turned up for a game of five-a-side. But this is Bexley  @magistrates@  court, not a leisure centre, and the sporty young men have come to plead their guilt or innocence. The wonder of courts like these is that anybody, for whatever motive, can drop in. I take my seat in the public gallery - three rows of wooden benches at the rear. The magistrates come in, two flush-faced chaps in their 50s and a stern-looking Asian woman of 35 or so. No robes or wigs: these are  @laymen@  dressed much like the rest of us. The lad with \"One Nation\" on his jacket is ushered into the dock. His crime, it turns out, is failing to pay a traffic fine of £250. Asked if there is anything he\'d like to say in  @mitigation@  , he  @shrugs@  and mumbles, \"I lost my job\". He shuffles his feet and sighs, wanting this to be over. The magistrates, having conferred, order him to pay off the fine at the rate of £10 a week. He steps down. One-third of fines in Britain are never paid. This will probably be one of them. I settle down for the next case, hoping for more action. Magistrates don\'t deal with rape and murder, of course; anything serious or complex is referred upward, for trial by judge and jury. Still, 96% to 98% of criminal cases in Britain are heard in courts like this one. Surely a mugging wouldn\'t be too much to ask. But it\'s all traffic: driving without due care and attention, driving a vehicle with faulty brakes or bald tyres, driving without a tax disc or MoT certificate or insurance. Especially the last. On the evidence of this court, no one in south London bothers with insurance. And though they plead guilty as charged, not one of them intended to get behind the wheel while uninsured, but did so only to help out a sick friend or an ancient relative or a woman in labour... An early  @guilty plea@  is taken as a sign of \"good character\" and usually rewarded with a lighter penalty. In fact, to judge by their solicitors\' mitigatory eulogies, the men I\'m seeing this morning are all pillars of the community. I look back on my own record - nicking those traffic cones as a teenager, exceeding speed limits - and I feel like a hardened criminal in comparison. Courtroom drama? I\'d find more drama in the multi-storey where my car is parked. But the last case before lunch is oddly gripping: a man who went through a red light. At 7.30 on a Sunday morning he\'s on his way to work when the car stalls as he is crossing a dual carriageway. This is highly dangerous, so when he manages to start the engine again he moves off to be safe; by this time, however, the lights ahead have turned red, and when he goes through them a policeman pulls him up. He thinks it was all a bit unfair: \"I\'m a train operator. My mind is totally red signals. I wouldn\'t jump them.\" Articulate and polite, he plays it perfectly. The magistrates are sympathetic, and one of them thinks he knows the road where the incident happened - \"That\'s right, beyond the roundabout near McDonald\'s.\" They dock him the mandatory three points, but give him an absolute discharge. I feel like cheering and follow him out as though acquitted myself, my faith in British justice miraculously restored. In the shopping centre, during the lunch break, I pass the woman magistrate. I\'m tempted to stop her so we can review the morning\'s cases together. But I decide that there\'s probably a law against it - some ancient statute about interfering with a magistrate in the course of his or her duty - and let her buy her sandwiches in peace. Back at the courthouse I head for court three, where a district judge is sitting. I feel intrusive because the court is so tiny: the public gallery is a single row of chairs behind the two solicitors. It seems a trial should be under way soon - yippee! - but the defendant, disappointingly, isn\'t there. Even worse, the offences to which, in absentia, he\'s pleading not guilty, are traffic offences. Back in count one, as the afternoon wears on, the traffic is more than traffic. The first female defendant of the day appears, charged with the theft of £60 worth of goods from Morrisons, a tricky case because the items were found about her person but she hadn\'t left the store. A little later, a man is charged with brandishing a \"bladed article\" (a kitchen knife) in the street, though he says he used it only to clear the ice from his windscreen. My last image is of a barber from south London in his early twenties. He drove a car without insurance and doesn\'t have a licence. Along with his guilty plea, he has written a letter of apology to the court: a relative urgently needed his help, so he got behind the wheel, but he now deeply regrets it. A case-hardened professional judge would see him off in 30 seconds, but the three magistrates enjoy a wonderful performance and let him go with a modest fine. This is what people\'s justice is all about. By 4.30, everything\'s done. I wander out, relieved to climb off the conveyor belt of human weakness and misery.

The circulation of the Blood William Harvey (1578-1657) undertook groundbreaking research into the circulation of the blood and the function of the heart. He  @dispelled@  the contemporary belief that blood was  @propelled@  through the body by a pulsing action in the arteries; instead, he argued, the heart was at the centre of the circulatory system. While at the University of Padua in Italy, Harvey was tutored by the scientist and surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius. Fabricius recognised that the veins in the human body had one-way  @valves@  , but was puzzled as to what their function could be. It was Harvey who went on to solve the riddle. In 1628, he published his findings in a book entitled \"An Anatomical Study of the Motion of the Heart and of the Blood in Animals\". His discovery was received with great interest and accepted in England at once, although it was greeted with some scepticism on the Continent. Apart from offering insight into the function of the heart, Harvey\'s work also debunked misconceptions about the role of the liver, the brain and the blood itself. His discovery left scientists with no choice but to reconsider the vast majority of medical theories which were up until then accepted, and to place medicine on a new footing. In effect, it was the beginning of modern medicine. The Smallpox Vaccine Born on 17th May 1749, Edward Jenner was the creator of the  @smallpox@  vaccine. It has been estimated that the task he started has led to the saving of more human lives than the work of any other person. Smallpox was the most feared and greatest killer of Jenner\'s time. In today\'s terms it was as deadly as cancer or heart disease. It killed 10% of the population, rising to 20% in towns and cities where infection spread easily. From the early days of his career Edward Jenner had been intrigued by  @country-lore@  which said that people who caught cowpox from their cows (a mild skin infection which cleared up by itself after a few days) could not @contract@ smallpox. In May 1796, a dairymaid consulted Jenner about a rash on her hand. He diagnosed cowpox, and at the same time decided that he would put the old wives\' tale to the test. He scratched the maid\'s hand with a scalpel, and infected several of his patients with cowpox. As he had anticipated, and undoubtedly to his great relief, none of them caught smallpox. Vaccination with cowpox became compulsory in 1853, and the technique of introducing material under the skin to produce protection against disease became universally known as vaccination, a word derived from the Latin name for the cow (vacca), in Jenner\'s honour.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34023, 10),

(34030, 'Barbed wire and other technology World War I (1914-1918) was supposed to be the war to end all wars, but it was in fact the beginning of all modern conflicts. The new technology that reached the  @battlefields@  forever changed the way that armies fought. It could be argued that technology had always played an important part in war, but previously it had not been so sophisticated, and above all, so destructive. However, it wasn\'t only  @armoured@  tanks, high-powered  @machine guns@  , and aerial  @bombardment@  as Adam Hochschild describes in his essay, To End All Wars, the most important innovation of all was the  @barbed wire@  fences, the most unassuming weapon used. What barbed wire did was prevent direct charges on the men in the  @trenches@  . Hochschild got it right, unlike Douglas Haig, the commander of the British forces in France. Haig said, \'I believe that the value of the horse and the opportunity for the horse in the future are likely to be as great as ever. Aeroplanes and tanks are only accessories to the men and the horse.\' As on so many other occasions, he could not have been more mistaken. \nRecognition of PTSD or \'Shell Shock\' \nPsychological victims of war are as old as war itself. The Bible, the Greeks, and Shakespeare all tell us this. But it wasn\'t until World War I that science began to understand this properly and give the kind of diagnoses that are familiar to us today. During the war, medics still thought that \'shell shock\', as it was known, was down to the physical impact of military explosions. But gradually another theory began to form: that what caused the peculiar symptoms exhibited by huge numbers of soldiers (80,000 in the British army alone) were emotional, not physical, stress factors - in particular, the proximity to death and the hideous sight of watching a friend - or enemy - meet a gruesome end. Traumatized soldiers shared many common symptoms, such as speech difficulties, twitches, anxiety, and digestive disorders. The thing doctors found baffling was that these symptoms persisted long after the war was finished. It wasn\'t until over 60 years later, in 1980, in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, that this affliction would be formally recognized as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. \nBlood Banks \nThe first blood banks, called \'blood depots\', were set up by Oswald Hope Robertson, a medical scientist and US Army Officer, while serving in France in 1917. Just before the war, in 1914, it had been discovered that transfused blood could be prevented from clotting if mixed with sodium citrate. In the same year it was established that blood could be stored in refrigerators. These two huge breakthroughs paved the way for Robertson\'s \'blood depots\'. Prior to this, blood transfusions had had to be made vein to vein, directly from donor to patient. Medics used the \'preserved\' blood at casualty stations for wounded soldiers. However, survival rates were not good because one vital thing they had overlooked was the importance of blood groupings (three blood groups, A, B, and O, had been identified in Vienna in 1901 by an Austrian, Karl Landsteiner). Nevertheless, the wartime advances led to a blood-donor service being established in London in 1922. Here all volunteers were tested for blood group and screened for diseases. The decline of aristocracy World War I had a devastating impact on the British upper classes. The sons of the aristocracy fortunate enough to survive the war returned to find their place in society no longer automatically assured. Their numbers were severely reduced - even the prime minister\'s son was killed. This meant that in the immediate post-war period, those who had been expected to become leaders - particularly in politics and business - were no longer there. There was also a fall in the number of those willing to work as their servants. History professor Joanna Bourke says, \'In the past, the servant class in upper-middle-class homes were those people whose family tradition was to work there. When someone left, the cook would recommend her niece - and that no longer happened.\' The introduction of conscription had turned a professional army into a civilian one. New officers could now come from humble backgrounds and, like the many thousands of emancipated women, they were not prepared to abandon the possibility of social advancement that the war had brought them and go back to being shopkeepers and servants. \nWomen\'s emancipation \nSomething that historians still wrangle over is how much World War I liberated women. In reality, women\'s work was already on the rise before 1914, and once the war was over many women went back to their old jobs. However, without doubt women successfully carried out a huge number of traditionally masculine roles during the war. And without doubt, some of the post-war fashions, such as the flapper garςonne (little boy) look, flew in the face of pre-war feminine dress codes. Also, crucially, it was after the war that women in certain countries achieved the most important political right: the right to vote. In Great Britain they could vote from the age of 30 in 1918; in Germany they could vote in 1919; in the USA women could vote in all states from 1920; but in France, not until 1944, towards the end of World War II. \n\'Broken faces\' - the first plastic surgery \nModern surgery was born in World War Ι. Civil and military hospitals acted as theatres of experimental medical intervention and the outbreak of war changed the course of plastic surgery forever. Trench warfare meant that the head and the face were especially exposed to enemy fire and received extensive trauma wounds. Countless veterans survived the war, but paid the price by ending up maimed, mutilated, and disfigured. These were the so-called \'broken faces\', named after the expression coined in France by Colonel Yves Picot, president of the Union des blessés de la face et de la tête, which was founded in 1921. By the end of hostilities, there were about 6.5 million war invalids in France. Surgeons from the warring countries faced a considerable flood of these \'broken faces\', and were charged with giving them human features again, to ease the plight of their reintegration into civil life.

(34056, 'Robert Matthews, a leading UK researcher, outlines his mission \nIt is one of the most @evocative@  phrases in the lexicon of science:  @artificial intelligence@  , \'Al\', the creation of machines that can think. Just the mention of it conjures up images of HAL, the all-too intelligent computer in 2001: A Space Odyssey, and C3PO, the chatty, batty robot from Star Wars. For over half a century, computer scientists have been working towards creating such machines, spending billions of pounds in the attempt. And hanging over their efforts has been a challenge set by a British mathematician widely regarded as the father of Al research: Alan Turing. During the 1930s, Turing showed, in theory at least, that a \'universal machine\' could be built, capable of performing all the tasks of any special-purpose computing machine. After war-time work on code-breaking, Turing helped to turn his discovery into the reality of an electronic computer. But he also believed his proof meant that computers could mimic the action of the human mind. In 1951, Turing published a prediction: by the end of the century, computers would be able to hold a five-minute conversation with humans and fool 30 per cent of them into believing they were dealing with another human being. It is a deadline that has come and gone, along with huge amounts of funding. Yet no computer is remotely close to passing the \'Turing Test\'. What went wrong? Why has no one succeeded in creating Al? In fact, Al is already here,  @earning its keep@  in banks, airports, hospitals, factories - even our own home and car. It may not be quite what many were led to expect, but then the story of real-life Al is one of misplaced dreams, bitter  @feuds@  and grant-grabbing hype. Today\'s computer scientists divide into two broad camps on the issue of Al. The pragmatists see Al as a means to creating machines that do for thinking what engines have done for physical labour - taking on tasks we humans would prefer not to do: spending endless hours  @scouring@  heaps of market data for trends or scanning piles of medical images for signs of disease. Then there are the  @visionaries@  , still wedded to Turing\'s challenge and trying to bring the sci-fi image to life. For them, Al is all about computerised \'assistants\' that solve your printer problems and cheeky-chappy robots that talk to strangers. There are some who even see Al as the route to understanding the workings of the human mind. Without doubt, it is the visionaries who have done most to get Al research on TV shows such as Tomorrow\'s World. It is the pragmatists, however, who have got Al out of the door and into successful applications: the neural network cooking controls of microwave ovens, for example, of the expert system that vets credit card transactions. When current Al technology is pushed closer to its sci-fi image, the results can be more irritating and impressive: witness Microsoft\'s Paperclip Assistant, and the Al-based \'help-desks\' of some high-tech companies. Even now, 50 years after work began on intelligent machines, only the bravest customers trust the automated telephone ticketing system at their local cinema. Even so, visionary Al researchers working away from the mainstream have pulled off some striking achievements. Herbert Simon\'s 1957 prediction that a computer would make a mathematical discovery came to pass 20 years later, when a logic-based program named AM, developed by Douglas Lenat at Stanford University, discovered that every even number greater than four seemed to be the sum of two odd primes. In fact, AM had been pipped to this discovery by the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach in the 18th century; nevertheless the rediscovery of \'Goldbach\'s Conjecture\' by AM caused a stir within the Al community. Simon\'s prediction that a computer would become world chess champion also came to pass - in a manner of speaking - in 1997, when IBM\'s Deep Blue computer beat Garry Kasparov, the greatest human exponent of the game. Most likely it will be one of the Al visionaries who finally creates a computer that passes Turing\'s 50-year-old test. For many in the mainstream Al community, however, beating the Turing Test is viewed as little more than a party trick. They are hard at work addressing far more basic issues in Al - like convincing computers to hand over the cinema tickets you\'ve paid for.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34055, 10),
(34060, 'In the summer of 1968, the experts at the RAND Corporation, America\'s  @foremost@  Cold War think tank, were considering a strange strategic problem. How could the US authorities successfully communicate after a nuclear war? No matter how thoroughly a network was armoured or protected, its switches and wiring would always be vulnerable to bombs. An attack could reduce any  @conceivable@  network to  @tatters@  . And how would the network itself be commanded and controlled? Any central authority would be an obvious and immediate target for an enemy missile. RAND  @mulled over@  this grim puzzle in deep military secrecy, and arrived at a daring solution. In the first place, they would design a network with no central authority. Furthermore, they would design it to operate while in tatters. The principles were simple. All the  @nodes@  in the network would be equal in status, each with its own authority to  @originate@  , pass and receive messages. The messages themselves would be divided into packets. Each packet would begin at some specified source node, and end at some other specified destination node. It would wind its way through the network on an individual basis. The route that the packet took would be unimportant. Only reaching its final destination would count. Basically, the packet would be tossed like a hot potato from node to node to node, until it ended up in the proper place. If big pieces of the network had been blown away, that simply wouldn\'t matter. This excited and intrigued many, because it did sound like a theory for an indestructible network. In the autumn of 1969, the first node was installed in UCLA. By December 1969, there were four nodes on the infant network, which was named ARPANET, after its Pentagon sponsor (the Advanced Research Projects Agency). An added bonus was that scientists and researchers could share one another\'s computer facilities from a great distance away. This was a very handy service, for computer time was precious in the early \'70s. In 1971 there were fifteen nodes in ARPANET; by 1972, thirty-seven nodes. And it was good. By the second year of operation, however, an odd fact became clear. ARPANET\'s users had warped the computer-sharing network into a dedicated, high-speed, federally subsidised electronic postal service. The main traffic was not long-distance computing, but news and personal messages. The invention of the mailing list followed naturally. This was an ARPANET broadcasting technique in which an identical message could be sent automatically to large numbers of network subscribers. Interestingly, one of the first really big mailing lists was \"SF-LOVERS,\" for science fiction fans. Discussing science fiction on the network was not work-related and was frowned upon by many ARPANET computer administrators, but this didn\'t stop it from happening. The ARPA\'s original software for communication was known as NCP, \'Network Control Protocol\', but as time passed and the technique advanced, NCP was superseded by a higher-level, more sophisticated standard known as TCP/IP. This software converted messages into streams of packets at the source, then reassembled them back into messages at the destination. As early as 1977, TCP/IP was being used by other networks to link to ARPANET. ARPANET itself remained fairly tightly controlled, at least until 1983, when its military segment broke off and became MILNET. But TCP/IP linked everyone to everyone else. And ARPANET itself, though it was growing, became a smaller and smaller neighbourhood amid the vastly growing constellation of other linked machines. As the \'70s and 80s advanced, other entire networks fell into the digital embrace of this ever-growing web of computers. Since TCP/IP was public domain, and the basic technology was decentralised and rather anarchic by its very nature, it was difficult to stop people from barging in and linking up. In fact, nobody really wanted to stop them from joining this branching complex of networks, which came to be known as \'the Internet\'. In 1984 the National Science Foundation got into the act. The new NSFNET set a blistering pace for technical advancement, linking newer, faster, shinier supercomputers, through thicker, faster links, upgraded and expanded, again and again in 1986, 1988 and 1990. And other government agencies leapt in: NASA, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy, each of them maintaining their own digital kingdom in the Internet confederation. A mere twenty years had passed since the invention of the ARPANET, but few people remembered it now. For it had become a happy victim of its own overwhelming success. Its users scarcely noticed for ARPANET\'s functions not only continued but steadily improved. The use of TCP/IP standards for computer networking is now global. In 1971, there were only a handful of nodes in the ARPANET network. Today there are hundreds of thousands of nodes, scattered over virtually every country in the world. Five hundred million people use this gigantic mother of all computer networks. The Internet\'s pace of growth in the early 1990s was spectacularly ferocious, at some point achieving a monthly growth of 20%. The number of \'host\' machines with direct connection to TCP/IP doubled every year from 1988 to 1997. The Internet moved out of its original base in military and research institutions, into elementary and high schools, as well as into public libraries and the commercial sector and, of course, into millions of homes. Why did so many people want to be on the Internet? One of the main reasons was simply freedom. The Internet is a rare example of a truly, modern, functional anarchy. There is no \'Internet Inc.\' There are no official censors, no bosses, no board of directors, no stockholders. This virtual freedom, many hold, was the major reason why this form of communication attracted so many users so quickly. And so the story goes. The real Internet of the future may bear very little resemblance to today\'s, or even today\'s predictions. Predictions have never seemed to have much to do with the seething, fugal development of the Internet. After all, today\'s Internet bears little resemblance to those original grim plans for RAND\'s post-holocaust command grid.

The BBC\'s very own Jeremy Paxman sits in his small airless office to the side of the main Newsnight newsroom. Today he is preoccupied with the changes in the police force announced by the Home Secretary. He watches the monitor  @transmitting@  the Prime Minister\'s statements, grumping and raising his eyebrows as one political  @platitude@  is followed by another. \"That\'s rubbish,\" he says at one point, and it\'s not clear whether he\'s talking about the PM or some other issue burning a hole in his intellect. Only months after its inception, Newsnight had already made itself a household name. Cajoling, intimidating, aggressive, revealing, persistent - Paxman comes across as the interviewer from hell, a newsman who refuses to learn to respect things he doesn\'t respect. The programme\'s editor admits that Paxman can be too \"macho and Oxbridge\" at times. But he\'s still there, a thorn in the side of the establishment. And it doesn\'t look like that thorn is going to be getting less sharp any time soon. Newsnight has been called many things: \"an important part of the democratic process\"; \"a traitor in our midst\", \"dangerous\", \"increasingly irrelevant\". For many years, we have been watching Paxman being attacked by politicians from all ranks for \"sneering interviews\", or in such brutal confrontations as the one where he dealt with a politician\'s evasive responses by asking him the same question 14 times. He is clearly the man British politicians love to hate. The public, however, remain loyal. On 4 June, 2001, a bruising encounter between the Prime Minister and Jeremy Paxman brought nearly 2.5 million viewers to Newsnight. The programme\'s ongoing success is living proof that people expect current affairs programmes to be hard-hitting and truth-searching. Especially after the BBC scrapped News at Ten, the public have turned to Newsnight in their search for more serious analysis in a world of increasingly consumer-oriented news. The programme is now twenty years old and Paxman, the most feared interviewer on British television, will remain dedicated to the original cause for the existence of Newsnight - asking politicians those tough questions that other current affairs programmes prefer not to. Sin Kevill, the editor who oversaw the programme\'s relaunch last January, says it now has a broader, more accessible agenda - from the documentary-style films from poor inner-city areas to arts and culture. Will this modernisation negatively affect the programme\'s depth? \"Definitely not. I\'m quite traditional,\" Kevill says. \"There are some things about Newsnight that will simply not change.\" The programme\'s role as the nagging voice of the nation\'s conscience is becoming more and more important. Viewers and listeners are increasingly overwhelmed by news, news and more news. Those programmes, of necessity, lack the one thing Newsnight has - context. \"There is a shortage of analysis and generally a lack of interest in whether people are telling the truth,\" Paxman says. \"Things rush on to television at a fantastic speed, get recycled, pushed out and not thought about again. It\'s one big sausage machine. This is not how a nation should perceive events and developments that affect its everyday existence.\" In an ill-inspired attempt to make news more \'accessible\' to the public, the BBC made the surprising announcement last summer that a former game show host and radio presenter was to join the Newsnight team. Was Paxman surprised when he heard the announcement last August?\" \"No.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because someone had phoned me to tell me about it.\" He pauses. He knows he\'s not answering the question. Was he surprised? \"Mind your own business.\" There is another long pause. \"I think he is very good on radio.\" Whatever the personal feelings Paxman harboured, and they were obviously not ones of positive excitement, the deal seems to have fallen through, and the team remains unchanged. Does Paxman ever think that he should change his style to something more in tune with the caring, sharing new millennium? Of course he doesn\'t. \"Any self-respecting journalist must be concerned to define for themselves what the important issue is and then to pursue it, and not blindly follow some line laid down by the vested interest in question.\" There have been discussions about a new, highbrow interview programme for Paxman in the style of his head-to-head with Bill Gates last October.

In the words of Sigmund Freud, \'Leonardo da Vinci was like a man who awoke too early in the darkness, while the others were all still asleep.\' Most people recognise the \'Mona Lisa\' or the \'Last Supper\' as examples of this artist\'s extraordinary capabilities. However, he was not just an artistic genius, but he was also a genius in the fields of architecture, engineering and science. His sketchbooks, with notes often written in mirror form, were full of ideas for his inventions.

After completing her Master\'s degree at Johns Hopkins University, Carson wrote a radio show which explored marine life. But it was her work in the 1940s that cemented her reputation. A fire ant eradication program caught her attention and she became immersed in the science of pesticides and environmental poisons. After working on her ideas for several years, she published Silent Spring in 1962. The nascent environmental movement drew inspiration from the work, and President John F. Kennedy demanded the testing of chemicals mentioned in it. As with all revolutionaries, she came under criticism. One biochemist wrote, \'If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages\'.

Fashion in this country is regarded as something of a juvenile pursuit, dominated by shock tactics and flights of fancy, clothes by and for the very young and very bold. Even older British designers inhabit a Peter Pan dream world of eternal pink hair. Which makes Betty Jackson, who is a British fashion designer but also most definitely a grown-up, something of an  @oddity@  . She designs a range for Marks & Spencer, the ultimate grown-up store. Her hair is not fuchsia but snowy white. There is no display of  @deliberate@  eccentricity: Jackson is a model of restraint. She wears nothing but her own designs - \'Why would I wear anybody else\'s?\' - and, in winter, nothing but black, sometimes adding touches of white in summer. She claims she does wear colour, because she sometimes wears denim, although I\'m not sure that that counts. So it is no surprise that Britain\'s obsession with  @tacky@  celebrity is not to her taste. \"Fashion reporting has become so  @trite@  . Fashion has always been involved in celebrity culture; we\'ve always dressed film stars and musicians, but now it seems to have taken over. And the quality of celebrity seems to have  @gone downhill@  .\" But as a regime, \"it works for me. And I don\'t think fashion is working unless it\'s in the context of someone living in it.\" For her, it is imperative that designs \'work\': \"When you see someone wearing your clothes, and they\'ve picked them out of all the choice that\'s out there, and they\'re wearing them, that\'s when you\'ve really done it.\" Jackson has, by any measure, really done it. Her business has survived more than 20 years in an industry where few see their 30th birthday before bankruptcy. What\'s more, Jackson has enjoyed a renewed cult following over the past few years, attracting a new generation of celebrity clients, such as ex-All Saint Melanie Blatt, who have brought a new  @buzz@  around the Betty Jackson label. Betty Jackson was born in Bacup, Lancashire, in 1949. Her mother \"was on committees, ran the home, looked glamorous\"; her father owned a shoe factory. But it was a mild yen for teenage rebellion, rather than a daughterly desire to follow her father into the rag trade, that led her to study fashion. \"I didn\'t really know what I wanted to do. All I knew was that I didn\'t want to go to university, which was what I was supposed to do. I was vaguely good at art, and there was a sit-in at Hornsey College of Art at the time, and I rather fancied the sound of that, so I announced I wanted to go to art college.\" Her father, clearly skilled at outmanoeuvring the wayward young Jackson, said that art college was fine, but insisted on Rochdale, which was just down the road. None the less, Jackson loved art college from the start. \"As soon as I got there I realised I\'d fortuitously come to the right place. There were all these exciting, interesting people, and the textiles department has a fantastic library of old Chinese and Mongolian textiles. That\'s where I started to enjoy messing about with cloth.\" After a year\'s foundation course, she went on to study fashion and textiles at Birmingham. After graduating in 1971, Jackson moved to London, working as a fashion illustrator. One day, at a friend\'s house, she met the designer Wendy Dagworthy (now professor of fashion at the Royal College of Art) and became a design assistant. A few years later she moved on to the fashion collective Quorum, and in 1981, Betty Jackson Ltd was born. The early years were \"the most incredibly exciting time. Everyone loved British fashion. We were turning away orders because we couldn\'t cope.\" After the high came a recession which saw many of Jackson\'s contemporaries go under. That Jackson survived has earned her enormous respect. To stay at the top of British fashion for any length of time is a huge challenge. If Jackson seems a great deal more down to earth than most designers, there is one event in her life that seems to have shaped this. Aged 21, during her last year as a student, she had a horrific car crash. As a result of her injuries she had one leg amputated. She spent a year at her parents\' home, confined to bed, passing a great deal of time drawing, which influenced her decision to begin her career as an illustrator rather than a designer. The accident also influenced her attitude to the fashion world. \"When you have a physical disability, fashion is hardly the obvious career because everyone is so gorgeous and glamorous. In a world obsessed with perfect-looking bodies, often at the expense of health, Jackson\'s disability has given her a different perspective. Not that she is any less enamoured of glamour: \"It would be lovely if everyone was 5ft 9, and slender and perfect,\" she says - but she knows that they\'re not. The accident \"made me realise that you can achieve very little on your own. I will never underestimate the power of a team\". Dagworthy is now a design consultant for Jackson, so has worked both as Jackson\'s boss and employee: \"We\'ve come full circle,\" Dagworthy says, \"which is rather nice.\" She describes Jackson as \"great to work with because she has a great sense of humour and generosity of spirit. She cares about the people who work with her. And she\'s loyal, which in fashion is a rarity.\"', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34117, 10),

A couple of years ago you did have to face driving several miles to your nearest supermarket to find such treats. But the  @saunter@  of a new breed of \'mini\' supermarket has changed all that; now you can  @over the odds@  to the end of your road to buy whatever the TV chef of the day has just recommended. But are you paying  @convenience stores@  for accessibility? If you live in a city, one or another of the big supermarket chains will have opened such a store near you, and they all have plans for many, many more. The contrast between these smaller versions of the supermarkets and the traditional \'open all hours\' impression we have of local corner shops could not be greater. They carry a wide range of stock that is attractively packaged, have good, clear layouts and often offer cashback or have cashpoints. It\'s not only quick to shop there, but easy and, on the whole, pleasant as well. It\'s not just the improvement in the  @advent@  that is encouraging shoppers to stay local. By walking to the shop you not only help your health and the environment, you also save the cost of petrol. If you are one of the many people who only use the car for the weekend shop, you could ditch it altogether. Buying a small amount of food daily, rather than doing a huge weekly shop can cut down on wastage of food, ending the discovery of rotting vegetables lurking in the crisper. Best of all, you avoid the agony of slogging around the supermarket for at least an hour on Saturday or Sunday. Not surprisingly, owners of more old-fashioned, independent stores feel threatened. Their main fear is that the supermarkets\' greater buying power will enable them to price the smaller stores out of the market. In reality, however, while large supermarkets undercut traditional convenience stores on a core range of products, on others they hike up the prices. An investigation conducted in several London stores showed that customers were paying between four and seven per cent more in supermarket convenience stores compared with the prices for exactly the same products in the larger format stores. The difference doesn\'t look much in terms of pounds and pence - 10p extra on six eggs, 3p on a litre of fabric softener, 6p more for 80 teabags compared with the prices in the main branches. But if you pop into your local mini supermarket on a regular basis, the premium prices soon add up. Even if the item you have gone to buy costs the normal price, the impulse to buy other products can cost you dearly. Research has shown that someone popping in to their local convenience store intending to buy only some bread would, on average, spend a total of £1,208 on products over just one year from that store. Supermarkets defend their policy, pointing out that overheads vary from one type of store to another: \"We have a national pricing policy, so our prices are the same in similar formats throughout the country. Prices do, however, vary between our differing formats as their resourcing requirements and cost structure vary. For example, our \'local\' convenience stores are open longer hours, and are generally in higher cost locations, such as city centres.\" It is true that their smaller outlets do face proportionately higher costs, partly because they are selling smaller quantities of goods, partly because of staffing requirements and partly because they have to pay higher council rates. Even so, you might expect customers to occasionally resent having to pay 15% more for, say, brand name tea bags just for the convenience. But no; according to research, consumers are queuing up to pay. If you are one of those who can\'t resist nipping in to your \'local\' shop, there are several ways to contain costs. Draw up a shopping list and stick to it. Cook from scratch if you have time; pre-prepared food costs more. Only take up special offers, such as three for the piece of two, if it applies to items you use regularly, and supplement with items from cheaper sources when possible - fruit and vegetables from your local market or farm shop, and the supermarket\'s own-brand tinned, frozen and other general groceries.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34123, 10),

Karyn Bosnak\'s actions were rather irresponsible: some might say they were unforgivable. The silly girl spent herself into $20,000 worth of debt buying Gucci purses and Prada shoes and then, like some street beggar, asked total strangers to bail her out. Amazingly, that is exactly what they did. But in her defence, her idea of setting up an internet site to plead for charity was a stroke of genius and she executed the idea with both enthusiasm and humour. She never forced her  @benefactors@  to hand over any money. One doesn\'t know whether to applaud or cut up her credit cards. Her story is a cautionary tale, morality tale and fairy tale all rolled into one and is told in her bestselling, memoir, Save Karyn: A True-Life Shopaholic\'s Journey to Debt and Back. Ploughing through its 400 pages, one can\'t help but wonder whether the author  @is having us on@  . But meeting Bosnak, you realize that her story is no joke. With her, what you see is what you get is a  @guileless@  ingénue, no more and no less. The Hollywood version of her story, she explains, portrays Bosnak as a wide-eyed, small town  @hick@  . In reality, she is anything but: brought-up in an upper-middle class Chicago family, she moved to New York in the summer of 2000, and ended up working in the tough world of a television court show. This was no empty-headed bimbo arriving, defenceless, in the Naked City; none the less, something in her snapped. Burberry coats, Gucci sunglasses, pedicures, manicures, panic-stricken clothes-buying  @binges@  ; these were all part of her road to ruin. She says she felt immature, lonely and intimidated by her new surroundings. \'I was in over my head and I didn\'t really know what I was doing,\' she says. So her excesses in the stores were just the fruit of her insecurity? Well, not quite. \'I like cute things and went crazy.\' In a desperate attempt at cost-cutting, she moved out of Manhattan and relocated across the river to cheaper Brooklyn. At one stage, she became unemployed. \'I was a month away from declaring bankruptcy,\' she recalls, \'and I thought: \"This sucks.\" I could see the end coming.\' Then she remembered a notice that her flatmate had spotted, pinned outside a supermarket, which begged for $7,000 and contained a row of phone numbers. It was then that the seed of her idea germinated. The plan worked. \'Hello! My name is Karyn, I\'m really nice and I\'m asking for your help!\' it announced. \'Bottom line is that I have this huge credit card debt and I need $20,000 to pay it off. All I need is $1 from 20,000 people, or $2 from 10,000 people, or 5$ from 4,000 people - you get the picture. So if you have an extra buck or two, please send it my way. Together, we can banish credit card debt from my life.\' \'What\'s in it for you, you ask? The plea went on. \'I\'ll be honest... nothing is really in it for you. But I do believe in karma.\' Her website, www.savekaryn.com, went live in the summer of 2002. Word-of-mouth notoriety and inclusion of the website on a national paper\'s list of \'hot sites\' really did \'save Karyn\'. It took 20 weeks but, eventually, donations from complete strangers, as large as $500 and as small as one cent, along with Bosnak\'s sale of her own clothes, CDs and furniture on eBay, raised the $20,000 she needed to return to the black. She also received countless gifts and stacks of abusive emails. When her identity was finally revealed, you could hardly pick up an American newspaper or turn on the television without bumping into the unlikely internet pioneer. Hers was the most successful, if not the first, instance of \'cyber panhandling\'. But she takes offence at being called a beggar. \'It wasn\'t as if the website had only one page and said: \'That\'s it, give me the dough,\' she says. \'I worked for hours on it every single night. It was funny. People gave me money not because they felt sorry for me, but because they had a chuckle.\' She was an entertainer, she says, paid for making others laugh. Bosnak sees herself as a kind of symbol. We have all been Karyns in our lives.

I think it\'s fair to say that crocodile-hunting polygamists from Papua New Guinea would add a certain  @frisson@  to any polite London  @soirée@  . Samuel and Christina, who is one of his two wives, are members of the 250-strong Insect tribe - hunter-gatherers. They hunt crocodiles with spears and stalk wild boar with bows and arrows. They speak their own language, Ngala, and practise polygamy, paying for wives\'  @dowries@  with seashells. One tribesman has 12 wives, another is said to have 112 children. PART 1 I first met them last year as I travelled the world to observe how ancient cultures and tribes were engaging with the ever-encroaching modern world. I lived in their remote village, Swagup, ate their food, shared their shelters, and mined their intimate family secrets. The tribe had everything they wanted. The village\'s witch doctor serviced all medical and spiritual requirements. Everything else - fish, boar, fruit, building, and hunting materials - was gathered from the jungle. The tribespeople thought of their home as a land of plenty - a paradise that has provided their livelihood for thousands of years. They had robustly defended their culture against all-comers. Their one concession was allowing missionaries to school them in basic English. The village school still teaches them the language today. The tribespeople revealed themselves to be as curious about my world as I was about theirs. They bombarded me with questions about Britain and our \'chief\' - or the Queen, as we call her. The tribe\'s own chief, a rather colourful character called Joseph, is elected by majority every five years and carries supreme authority. Sitting in his wooden, three-storey palace, the chief and I got to talking and, to return the overwhelming hospitality that they had shown me, I invited him and his kin to undertake the 12,000-mile journey to my home in Wimbledon, south-west London. The tribespeople have never before travelled beyond their local stamping ground. Making the journey were Joseph, Samuel, Christina, Steven and one of his three wives, Delma, and James. Together they made up the Swagup Six, a party of Stone Age travellers coming to a microchip world. \'I don\'t know what magic they have in Britain, but I\'m about to find out,\' the chief declared. PART 2 At Heathrow airport, every escalator was met with terror and every lift with suspicion until one of them, usually Steven, an expert crocodile hunter, ventured forth, followed by the rest of the tribe. From Terminal 4, with spears on their backs and bows over their shoulders, the Swagup Six bravely ventured into our world. My guests were fascinated by everyday scenes and situations. They believed the barren winter trees were dead. The battery-powered cries of my daughter\'s doll drew shrieks from the women. Samuel and Christina were interested in how Ameera and I related to each other. They seemed to suspect it was Ameera who wore the trousers - unthinkable in their world. But whatever Samuel and Christina secretly thought, they maintained a public front of broad-mindedness. The chief\'s guiding principle was: \'When in London...\' Nonetheless, some of the capital\'s tourist spots proved a challenge. At the London Eye, the tribe held congress in the shadow of the huge wheel. \'It not meant for humans,\' was the consensus. Eventually the chief decided that they should try to enjoy the bird\'s-eye view of London. When their capsule reached the summit, the chief asked for our \'spirit house\' to be pointed out. He found the great dome of St Paul\'s Cathedral remarkable - not for its grandeur but for its diminutive stature. \'In our village, no building can be bigger than the spirit house,\' he said. However, the London Underground inspired awe. Astounded by the enormity of the network, James was convinced the Underground was built first, with the rest of London built on top later. Spirits were also raised by the prospect of a visit to Buckingham Palace. As a tribal leader in a Commonwealth country, Joseph regards himself as the Queen\'s representative. We dutifully put in a request for a meeting, but unfortunately it was declined. In his part of the world, he is a king. Here, sadly, he is just another tourist. After our trip to London, we spent some time in Wales, where the group encountered snow for the first time. \'This is strange sand that falls from the sky,\' the chief said. \'When will it stop?\' However, they were soon throwing snowballs with pinpoint accuracy. Their attitude and enthusiasm highlighted for me how jaded we have become, and how indifferent we are to wonderful sights on our own doorstep. The Swagup Six embraced our culture but without renouncing an ounce of their own. The goodbyes at Heathrow were emotional. \'We come from the same pot,\' Samuel said, standing beside Christina.

Knowing how to behave abroad can save people from some major social  @gaffes@  . However, etiquette writers and experts disagree over how far people should go in complying with foreign habits and customs that can create great discomfort to the  @uninitiated@  . Some visitors follow a rule of thumb. They weigh how much displeasing their host manners to them against their degree of personal discomfort. \'During our briefings, we help people develop respect for the country they are going to live in,\' said Claire Stewart, who works for an organisation which teaches manners to people being transferred overseas by their companies or universities. Letitia Baldridge, an authority on manners in the United States and the author of a book on the subject, said: \'Good manners are not elite, artificial or snobbish ways of behaving. Manners are a combination of  @common sense@  and consideration for others. It\'s 75 per cent common sense and 25 per cent thinking about others.\' Ms Baldridge, who began her career as social secretary to an ambassador and his wife at the US  @embassy@  in Paris, now teaches manners to international executives and charges thousands of dollars a session. Her advice covers every aspect of social behaviour, including smoking manners, flag etiquette for banquets, writing letters of apology, and the proper form for business cards. Everywhere, it has become extremely complicated to be polite. Not only are customs different but in many countries standards of behaviour have changed in recent years. A young British banker recently found himself at a house party in Sydney. After a barbecue, the hosts invited everyone to climb into a large bath tub to relax. The hosts\' rule was that to participate you had to take your clothes off. \'I had the opinion of not going in, but you feel a bit of a fool if everybody else in there is naked,\' said the banker, who decided to take the plunge. To make matters worse, he was attending the house party with his boss. The hot-tub session, during which business was discussed, lasted three hours. \'Even though it felt quite good, an Englishman\'s reserve scarcely allows him to feel comfortable in these circumstances,\' he said. \'Coming out is just as embarrassing. I was all wrinkly.\' Mrs Stewart said she believed that the banker had done the right thing, although he had an option. He could \'have had the  @sangfroid@  to decline with grace without making the Australians feel stupid,\' she said. In a business situation, \'short of doing something unethical,\' the best advice is usually \'to go along with whatever the foreign custom is,\' she added. Alexander Moorrees, a young American investment banker in London, was invited by some British friends to spend a weekend at their home in the country. The weather was below freezing.

(34188, 'Hundreds of people claim to have captured spooks and poltergeists in snapshots. But is a picture really worth a thousand ghost stories? Or is there more to these photogenic phantoms than meets the eye? We investigate five paranormal photos... The Brown Lady of Raynham This picture of the Brown Lady of Raynham Hall is among the best known of all alleged ghost photos. The \'spirit\' is that of Dorothy Walpole, a one-time resident of the manor located in Norfolk, England. First  @sighted@  in 1835, the ghost was reported on several subsequent occasions, making Raynham Hall a favourite spot for ghost hunters. In 1936, magazine photographers Captain Provand and Indre Shira were on a shoot at Raynham when Shira  @reportedly@  saw the ghost on a staircase. Provand then took the picture shown here. This is unlike the majority of ghost photos, in which the ghost is generally undetected by the photographer until the film has been processed. The Brown Lady photo has been widely  @hailed as@  one of the most  @undeniably@  authentic ghost photos ever taken. But many experts, including investigative writer and photo analyst Joe Nickell, have agreed that the picture was faked by  @superimposing@  one image on another. The Ghost of Lincoln William Mumler was a 19th century Boston engraver who  @dabbled@  in the then recent technological advance called photography. In 1861, less than forty years after the world\'s first photograph, Mumler noticed a strange, ethereal face next to his in a self-portrait he had taken. He discovered that an accidental double exposure caused the effect, and he figured out how to duplicate it. Mumler began a new career as a spirit medium. Sitters were willing to pay exorbitant fees to have him take their picture, which Mumler would doctor with surrounding ghostly images. The added faces were often interpreted as deceased loved ones or celebrities. In the photo shown here, Mumler has inserted the image of the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln. Mumler\'s trickery inspired a long line of successors. Photographers used similar techniques through the early 20th century to great fanfare. However, things began to crumble when word got out that many of the ghostly spectres in his photos were recognizably living Boston townsfolk. This led him to move his operations to New York , but he was brought to trial in 1869 and charged with fraud. Flora Louden In spite of Mumler\'s proven dishonesty, a few of the ghost pictures that surfaced in the decade following when he worked are worthy of attention. For example, there is the work of Ed Wyllie. The ghosts in his photographs have the same familiar pasted-in appearance as other spirit extras, but the stories behind his pictures are compelling. In 1901, Wyllie\'s claims were investigated by Reverend Charles Cook, a reputed sceptic. The picture shown here is a portrait of Cook taken by Willie and developed under Cook\'s supervision. Cook reported that Wyllie had no opportunity to introduce a fake spirit extra to the negative. More importantly, Cook recognised the girl whose image appeared next to his as Flora Louden, his college classmate from 1866, who had died in Ohio in 1873. Cook also revealed that the flower, the cross and the heart were symbols of private meaning in his relationship with Louden. But this is not irrefutable proof. Cook was not the most reliable of debunkers, since we know that on another occasion he was deceived by disingenuous spectre photographer Alex Martin. He could well have been deceived here, by his faded memories of a long-last love. Faces in the sea In December 1924, an accident at sea took the lives of two crewmen of the S.S. Watertown. James Courtney and Michael Meehan succumbed to toxic gas fumes in the cargo tank, and were given traditional burials at sea. The following day, the Watertown\'s captain and crew saw two ghostly faces in the water trailing behind the ship. Everyone agreed that the faces were plainly visible, remaining intact for long moments before dissipating. The captain got a camera and took six pictures of the heads. Once they were developed, five of them showed nothing but blank waves. The sixth, shown here, contained rough outlines that approximate two sets of human features. The Watertown crew may have been suffering from mass hysteria following the sudden demise of their fellow seamen. In times of stress, a tightly-knit group of people can become easily suggestible and even share communal delusions. Like clouds, swirls of ocean foam provide an excellent canvas on which the human mind may imagine patterns where there are none. The Hollywood Ghost Boy The honour of being the best known ghost picture of recent years probably goes to an unlikely candidate: the so-called \'ghost boy\' in the movie \"Three Men and a Baby\". The comedy had its cinematic release in 1987, and it wasn\'t until it had been out on home video for a while that the ghost stories surrounding the film began to circulate. In one of the final scenes, a figure is briefly visible behind the curtains of a window. It looks like a motionless young boy. The popular rumour is that a boy had died in the house where the movie was filmed, and his ghost returned to haunt the film crew. However, the scene in question was shot on a Hollywood soundstage, not in a real home where anyone ever lived or died. And the \'boy\' everyone has seen was not a ghost - he was cardboard. According to the cast and crew, the mysterious figure was a life-size cardboard cutout of the movie\'s star, Ted Danson. Someone on the set propped it up in front of the window as a prank.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34187, 10),

(34214, 'Alain de Botton describes how in 1925 French architect Le Corbusier proposed a  @drastic@  plan to rebuild the historic centre of Paris. I once spent a summer in a small hotel in the second arrondissement of Paris,  @a stone\'s throw@  away from the chilly seriousness of the old National Library, where I repaired every morning in a vain attempt to research a book I hoped to write. It was a lively part of town, and I would often sit in a café  @adjacent@  to my hotel named, as if out of a tourist guide, Chez Antoine. Everyone, it seemed,  @dropped by@  Chez Antoine at some point in the day. Elegant women would have coffee and a cigarette at the counter in the morning. Policemen lunched there, students  @whiled away@  the afternoons on the covered terrace, and by evening there\'d be scholars, politicians, divorcees and tourists, flirting, arguing, having dinner, smoking and playing pinball. As a result, although I was alone in Paris, and went for days hardly speaking to anyone, I felt none of the  @alienation@  with which I was familiar in other cities. That summer I imagined no greater happiness than to be able to live in Paris for ever, pursuing a routine of going to the library, ambling the streets and watching the world from a corner table at Chez Antoine. I was therefore surprised to find out, some years later, that the very area in which I had stayed had fallen within a zone which one of the most intelligent and influential architects of the twentieth century had wanted systematically to dynamite and replace with a great park punctuated at intervals with eighteen 60-storey cruciform towers stretching up to the lower slopes of Montmartre. Le Corbusier had drawn up his Parisian scheme at a moment of unequalled urban crisis. Across the developing world, cities were exploding in size. In 1800 the French capital was home to 647,000 people. By 1910 three million were squeezed within its inadequate confines. In apartment buildings, several families typically shared a single room. In 1900, in the poorer districts of Paris, one toilet generally served 70 residents. A cold-water tap was a luxury. Factories and workshops were sited in the middle of residential areas, emitting smoke and deadly effluents. Children played in courtyards covered with raw sewage. Cholera and tuberculosis were a constant threat. Streets were choked by traffic day and night. There was not much that was picturesque about the early-twentieth-century city. Le Corbusier was horrified by such conditions. \'All cities have fallen into a state of anarchy,\' he remarked. \'The world is sick.\' Given the scale of the crisis, drastic measures were in order, and the architect was in no mood to feel sentimental about their side effects. \'The existing centres must come down,\' he said. \'To save itself every great city must rebuild its centre.\' In order to alleviate overcrowding, the ancient low-rise buildings would have to be replaced by a new kind of structure only recently made possible by advances in reinforced concrete technology: the skyscraper. \'2,700 people will use one front door,\' marvelled Le Corbusier. By building upwards, two problems would be resolved at a stroke: overcrowding and urban sprawl. With room enough for everyone in towers, there would be no need to spread outwards and devour the countryside in the process. There would be ample green space as well, as up to 50 per cent of urban land would be devoted to parks. The new city would itself be a vast park, with large towers dotted among the trees. On the roofs of the apartment blocks, there would be games of tennis, and sunbathing on the shores of artificial beaches. Simultaneously, Le Corbusier planned to abolish the city street. He resented the fact that the legitimate demands of both cars and people were constantly and needlessly compromised, and he therefore recommended that the two be separated. In the new city, people would have footpaths all to themselves, winding through woods and forests (no pedestrian will ever meet an automobile, ever!), while cars would enjoy massive and dedicated motorways, with smooth, curving interchanges, thus guaranteeing that no driver would ever have to slow down for the sake of a pedestrian. The division of cars and people was but one element in Le Corbusier\'s plan for a reorganization of life in the new city. All functions would now be untangled. There would no longer be factories, for example, in the middle of residential areas. The new city would be an arena of green space, clean air, ample accommodation and flowers.', 1, 1, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 34213, 10),

(34220, 'Benjamin Houston Calling King\'s address \'the greatest in history\' is a  @tall order@  for any historian and for any speech to live up to. It certainly should be classed as among a handful of  @momentous@  speeches in US history, perhaps second only to the Gettysburg Address. The speech  @crystallises@  some of King\'s greatest gifts, not least of which an ability to address diverse audiences with one voice - to both revive the souls of the march participants and to stir the consciences of the greater public beyond, to speak eloquently to the African-American experience and yet also to the wider American spirit. He meant to give \'new meaning\', as he said in the speech, to old words and clichés that nonetheless were rooted in broader  @notions@  of the American Dream. His soaring  @oratory@  at the March on Washington spoke of cashing a cheque, of laying claim to the economic aspirations that remained largely out of reach of African-Americans. It  @foreshadowed@  King\'s deepening critique of American society that would dominate his thoughts and the social and political conflicts of the 1960s. Clive Webb On 28 August 1963, a quarter of a million demonstrators, black and white, converged on the capital of the United States to participate in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. Almost singing the words in his great baritone voice, Dr Martin Luther King, Jr. described his dream of a United States that a century later finally fulfilled the promise of President Abraham Lincoln\'s Emancipation Proclamation. King\'s inclusive vision of a country united across its racial and religious divide emphasised the idealism and determination of a civil rights movement that had over a decade of struggle developed an unstoppable political and moral momentum. While many commentators observe that the March on Washington had a negligible impact on the eventual passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, none deny the importance of the event in awakening the national consciousness to the question of civil rights. King\'s speech resonated not only throughout the United States but also across the world. A Telstar communication satellite performed what one British newspaper described as \'its most dramatically historic duty so far\' and enabled audiences in the UK to witness the march, although only the end was live. Dr George Lewis For many of the strategists who were close to King and activists who were present, this was not even the greatest speech at the March on Washington, let alone of King\'s career. In terms of oratorical style it was curiously subdued, lacking the tone and rhythm that characterised the southern Baptist church where King was a preacher. In terms of content, the most significant section of the speech was not its \'Dream\' section but an earlier passage which detailed the real reason that lay behind the gathering at the March on Washington: that black Americans had been given a \'bad cheque\' at the time of their supposed emancipation 100 years previously, which they were now coming to Washington to demand to be cashed. The idea of a \'Dream\' caused consternation: King\'s colleagues judged it repetitive to the point of cliché; radical student activists were dismayed to hear a black leader dreaming of a far-off future. For those who had not heard King\'s oratory previously, however, the reaction was altogether different, and this is where the genius of the speech truly lies. Deep in the White House, President John F. Kennedy openly declared that King was \'damn good\'.

(38902, 'Why Japan\'s Crime Rate Is So Low\n\nIn July 2016, a knife attack in Japan killing 19 people sent shockwaves across the country.\nThis was the largest mass killing ever seen in Japan’s modern history. In fact, over the last 60 years, Japan’s violent @crime@ rate has steadily declined, and today, the country has one of the lowest homicide rates in the world. So why is Japan so safe?\nWell, many attribute the low rate of crime to the low rate of gun ownership. According to separate reports by the University of Chicago and the United Nations, just one in 175 households in Japan own firearms, compared to the United States, where it is one in three. This is largely because Japan makes purchasing a gun extremely difficult. Most firearms are @illegal@ , as the country’s 1958 weapons control law states that \"No person shall possess firearms or swords\" and even exceptions to this law are heavily regulated. According to the Atlantic, buying a gun in Japan requires a rigorous background check, screenings for mental illness and sobriety, as well as an all-day class ending in a written exam.\nWhat’s more, gun owners must provide law enforcement with the exact location of their weapon and ammunition, both of which much be locked and stored separately. Gun owners are even required to retake the class every three years, and hand over their weapon to police for annual exams.\nOthers credit Japan’s safety to its highly efficient criminal @justice@ system. Police extract confessions from 95 percent of those arrested, and according to their own data, solve 98 percent of homicide cases. \nThe @conviction@ rate is also reportedly very high. At 99% as juries do not exist. But Japan’s criminal justice system is not perfect. Courthouses are understaffed and Judges are reportedly promoted according to the speed by which they process @cases@ .\nThis pressure to convict provides the illusion that every crime is investigated and solved, but many allege that the system does not paint an accurate picture of violent crime rates in Japan. This is all against the backdrop of Japan’s uniquely non-violent culture, which strongly emphasizes honor and politeness, and considers anger and aggression shameful, even childish.\nSome experts link this to the aftermath of World War Two, when Japan constitutionally and philosophically rejected violence after being victim to two nuclear attacks. Soon after, the crime rate began to steadily drop and today, Japanese men @commit@ roughly a tenth of the homicides than they did in the mid 20th century.\nThere are a slew of other reasons why the Japanese are, for the most part, abiding by the law. Some experts point to the country’s low rates of poverty, unemployment and drug use. But it\'s likely that not one but a combination of these factors that make Japan one of the safest countries in the world.', 1, 1, 0, 'Why Japan\'s Crime Rate Is So Low', NULL, NULL, NULL, 38901, 10),
(38904, 'Why Truly Sociable People Hate Parties\n\nThe idea of being a @sociable@ person is nowadays heavily associated with finding enjoyment in going to, and in all likelihood also in giving, parties. To be sociable means welcoming the idea of being in a room replete with an above-average number of other @guests@ , many of whom will be unknown, most of whom will be holding a glass of alcohol, bantering, with lights lower than they normally would be, and @music@ somewhat higher than required in order faithfully to catch the details of another\'s voice.\n @ Parties@ have become synonymous with sociability because of certain underlying ideas about what true social connection might require and entail. We assume that sociability naturally springs up when lots of people are put together in a room, that it means speaking a lot and notably cheerfully about things that have been happening in our lives, that it depends on a jokey manner and - ideally - on the possession of a few entertaining anecdotes, often involving striking coincidences. But such assumptions sidestep two sizeable objections. Firstly, true sociability - that is a real connection between two people - is almost never built up via anything @cheerful@ . It is the result of making ourselves vulnerable before another person, by revealing something that is broken, lost, confused, lonely and in pain within us.
